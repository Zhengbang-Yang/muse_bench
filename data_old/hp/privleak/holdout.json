[{"text": "shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\"\n\u3000\u3000The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, Id better go. There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now .....\n\u3000\u3000Dobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed. \"Farewell, Harry Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to\n\u3000\u3000tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was starting to grow on me.\"\n\u3000\u3000The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.\n\u3000\u3000Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.\n\u3000\u3000They were almost at King's Cross when Harry remembered something.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny - what did you see Percy doing, that he didn't want you to tell anyone?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy's got a girlfriend.\" Fred dropped a stack of books on George's head.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny. \"That's who he was writing to all last summer. He's been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was -- you know - attacked. You won't tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early.\n\u3000\u3000\"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering.\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he'll know. Call me at the Dursleys', okay? I can't stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won't they?\" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did this year?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could've died, and I didn't manage it? They'll be furious ......\n\u3000\u3000And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world. '\n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\u3000\u3000by J.K. Rowling\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ONE\n\u3000\u3000OWL POST\n\u3000\u3000Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\n\u3000\u3000It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless discuss.\"\n\u3000\u3000The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:\n\u3000\u3000Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in various disguises.\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'd probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\n\u3000\u3000The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic", "input_ids": [1, 4091, 748, 1286, 1699, 540, 1497, 21334, 29883, 873, 29892, 13330, 1623, 472, 3237, 29889, 3792, 1181, 29891, 29889,

{"text": "to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugle git.\"\n\u3000\u3000It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious. And there was more....\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he'd opened them, the map had had its last word.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair , the slimeball.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited for the blow to fall.\n\u3000\u3000\"So...\" said Snape softly. \"We'll see about this....\"\n\u3000\u3000He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lupin!\" Snape called into the fire. \"I want a word!\"\n\u3000\u3000Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"You called, Severus?\" said Lupin mildly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly did,\" said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. \"I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Snape again. \"This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction, warned him not to interrupt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Full of Dark Magic?\" he repeated mildly. \"Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. \"You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?\" he said. \"Harry, do you know any of these men?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You see, Severus?\" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. \"It looks like a Zonko product to me --\"\n\u3000\u3000Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff,\" he choked. \"Bought -- it... in Zonko's... ages -- ago...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well!\" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. \"That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back, shall I?\" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. \"Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor, I --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to hear explanations,\" said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. \"I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it' s a map,\" he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. \"I don't want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let you have it back, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because...,\" Lupin hesitated, \"because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely entertaining.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know them?\" said Harry, impressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've met,\" he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.\"\n\u3000\u3000He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go and get it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's my fault,\" said Ron abruptly. \"I persuaded you to go. Lupin's right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --\"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart plummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?\n\u3000\u3000\"Come to have a good gloat?\" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front of them. \"Or have you just been to tell on us?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling. \"I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\u3000\u3000THE QUIDDITCH FINAL\n\u3000\u3000He sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts. Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all the help you gave us.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't do this,\" said Harry. \"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scab", "input_ids": [1, 304, 11386, 317, 1056, 412, 29892, 322, 1812, 29879, 1075, 304, 3013, 670, 633, 12324, 635,

back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's gorgeous, isn't he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\n\u3000\u3000That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione's arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what about Scabbers?\" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. \"He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it with that thing around?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" he said, smiling as he looked up. \"How are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with A their shopping.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"They still haven't caught him, then?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They've pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It'd be good to get some more money --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \"Black's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back, You mark my words.\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered \"hello\" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, \"Harry. How nice to see you.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Percy,\" said Harry, trying not to laugh.\n\u3000\u3000I hope you're well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well, thanks --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. \"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Marvelous,\" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. \"Absolutely spiffing.\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy scowled.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's enough, now,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum!\" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her hand too. \"How really corking to see you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said, that's enough,\" said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair. \"Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting news?\" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest. \"Second Head Boy in the family!\" she said, swelling with pride.\n\u3000\u3000\"And last,\" Fred muttered under his breath.\n\u3000\u3000I don't doubt that,\" said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \"I notice they haven't made you two prefects.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do we want to be prefects for?\" said George, looking revolted at the very idea. \"It'd take all the fun out of life.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny giggled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!\" snapped Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,\" said Percy loftily. \"I'm going up to change for dinner...\"\n\u3000\u3000He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\n\u3000\u3000\"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\n\u3000\u3000\"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?\" asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,\" said Mr. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone looked up at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Percy curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's because of you, Perce,\" said George seriously. \"And there'll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?\" Percy asked again, in a dignified voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, as we haven't got one anymore,\" said Mr. Weasley,\n\u3000\u3000\"-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr. Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he was under Pressure.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thing, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley briskly. \"Do you realize how much luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the Muggle Underground.... You are all packed, aren't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet,\" said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. \"He's dumped them on my bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much time in the morning,\" Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.\n\u3000\u3000After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was

flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded \nbag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch\u2019s handbag. \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s Mafalda Hopkirk,\u201d he said, reading a small card that identified their victim \nas an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \u201cYou\u2019d better take this, Hermione, \nand here are the tokens.\u201d \n\n He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., \nwhich he had taken from the witch\u2019s purse. \n\n Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, \nand within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed \nMafalda\u2019s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\u201d \n\n They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the \nInvisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds \nlater there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them. \n\n \u201cOh, hello, Mafalda.\u201d \n\n \u201cHello!\u201d said Hermione in a quavery voice, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d \n\n \u201cNot so good, actually,\u201d replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly \ndowncast. \n\n As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along \nbehind them. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re under the weather,\u201d said Hermione, talking firmly over \nthe little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him \nfrom reaching the street. \u201cHere, have a sweet.\u201d \n\n \u201cEh? Oh, no thanks \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI insist!\u201d said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. \nLooking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. \n\n The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the \nlittle wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a \nhandful of hairs from the top of his head. \n\n \u201cOh dear!\u201d she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better \ntake the day off!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no!\u201d He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being \nunable to walk straight. \u201cI must \u2013 today \u2013 must go \u2013 \u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cBut that\u2019s just silly!\u201d said Hermione, alarmed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to work in this state \n\u2013 I think you ought to go to St. Mungo\u2019s and get them to sort you out.\u201d \n\n The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the \nmain street. \n\n \u201cYou simply can\u2019t go to work like this!\u201d cried Hermione. \n\n At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to \nclaw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving \nnothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying \nchunks of vomit. \n\n \u201cUrgh,\u201d said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of \nsick. \u201cIt would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard\u2019s bag, \u201cbut I \nstill think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on \nhis job, though, isn\u2019t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\u201d \n\n Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick \nwizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. \n\n \u201cWeird he wasn\u2019t wearing them today, wasn\u2019t it, seeing how much he wanted to \ngo? Anyway, I\u2019m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\u201d \n\n \u201cNow wait here,\u201d Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \n\u201cand we\u2019ll be back with some hairs for you.\u201d \n\n He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in \nthe sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron \nand Hermione reappeared. \n\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black \nhairs, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he\u2019s pretty tall, you\u2019ll need \nbigger robes \u2026\u201d \n\n She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry \nretired to take the potion and change. \n\n Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, \nfrom what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a \nbeard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the \nother two. \n\n \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him. \n\n \u201cTake one of Mafalda\u2019s tokens,\u201d Hermione told Harry, \u201cand let\u2019s go, it\u2019s nearly \nnine.\u201d \n\n They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded \npavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled \nGENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. \n\n \u201cSee you in a moment, then,\u201d said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down \nthe steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending \ninto what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and \nwhite. \n\n \u201cMorning, Reg!\u201d called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a \ncubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \u201cBlooming pain in the bum, \nthis, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry \nPotter?\u201d \n\n\f\n The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cstupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. \n\n To Harry\u2019s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and \npeered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted \nfeet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. \n\n \u201cWe have to flush ourselves in?\u201d he whispered. \n\n \u201cLooks like it,\u201d Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly. \n\n They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. \n\n He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be \nstanding in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the \nchain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into \nthe Ministry of Magic. \n\n He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. \nThe great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain \nhad filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished \nwooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was \nrather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved \nthrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. \nEngraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. \n\n Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs.

The only thing that was out of place was the troll\u2019s leg umbrella stand, \nwhich was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again. \n\n \u201cI think somebody\u2019s been in here,\u201d Hermione whispered, pointing toward it. \n\n \u201cThat could\u2019ve happened as the Order left,\u201d Ron murmured back. \n\n \u201cSo where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?\u201d Harry asked. \n\n \u201cMaybe they\u2019re only activated if he shows up?\u201d suggested Ron. \n\n Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared \nto move farther into the house. \n\n \u201cWell, we can\u2019t stay here forever,\u201d said Harry, and he took a step forward. \n\n \u201cSeverus Snape?\u201d \n\n Mad-Eye Moody\u2019s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them \njump back in fright. \u201cWe\u2019re not Snape!\u201d croaked Harry, before something whooshed over \nhim like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. \nBefore he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. \n\n The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron \nwas making retching noises; Hermione stammered, \u201cThat m-must have b-been the T-\nTongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\u201d \n\n Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at \nthe end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up \nout of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. \nBlack, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, \n\n\f\nits waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty \neye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at \nHarry. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. \n\u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t us! We didn\u2019t kill you \u2013\u201c \n\n On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes \nwatering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with \nher arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her \nclumsily on the shoulder and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all r-right. . . . It\u2019s g-gone. . . .\u201d \n\n Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black \ncontinued to scream. \n\n \u201cMudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a \nburst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. \n\n \u201cThat . . . that was . . . \u201c Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t really him, was it? Just something to scare \nSnape.\u201d \nHad it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure \naside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the \nother two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved \nexcept for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. \n\n \u201cBefore we go any farther, I think we\u2019d better check,\u201d whispered Hermione, and \nshe raised her wand and said, \u201cHomenum revelio.\u201d \n\n Nothing happened. \n\n \u201cWell, you\u2019ve just had a big shock,\u201d said Ron kindly. \u201cWhat was that supposed to \ndo?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt did what I meant it to do!\u201d said Hermione rather crossly. \u201cThat was a spell to \nreveal human presence, and there\u2019s nobody here except us!\u201d \n\u201cAnd old Dusty,\u201d said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-\nfigure had risen. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s go up,\u201d said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led \nthe way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. \n\n Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in \nthe drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron \ncrossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. \n\n \u201cCan\u2019t see anyone out there,\u201d he reported. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think, if Harry still had a \nTrace on him, they\u2019d have followed us here. I know they can\u2019t get in the house, but \u2013 \nwhat\u2019s up, Harry?\u201d \n\n Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned against as something flashed \nacross his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that \nwas not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. \n\n \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \u201cDid you see him at my \nplace?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2013 he\u2019s really angry \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut that could be at the Burrow,\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cWhat else? Didn\u2019t you see \nanything? Was he cursing someone?\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2013 I couldn\u2019t tell \u2013\u201c \n\n Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a \nfrightened voice, \u201cYour scar, again? But what\u2019s going on? I thought that connection had \nclosed!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt did, for a while,\u201d muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard \nto concentrate. \u201cI \u2013 I think it\u2019s started opening again whenever he loses control, that\u2019s \nhow it used to \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to close your mind!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. \u201cHarry, \nDumbledore didn\u2019t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that\u2019s \nwhy you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images \nin your mind, remember \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYeah, I do remember, thanks,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need \nHermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between \nthem to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius\u2019s death. He wished that he \nhad not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as \nthough he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was \nbuilding and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. \n\n He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry \nof the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again \nand spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land \nupon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the \nvoice of Ron\u2019s father. \n\n \u201cFamily safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\u201d \n\n The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper \nand a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re all right, they\u2019re all right!\u201d she whispered, and Ron half laughed and \nhugged her. \n\n \u201cHarry,\u201d he said over Hermione\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s your \nfamily, \u2018course you were worried. I\u2019d feel the same way.\u201d He thought of Ginny. \u201cI do feel \nthe same way.\u201d \n\n The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had", "input_ids": [1, 29879, 5637, 29889,

party.\" \n\n \n\nHis eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. \n\n\"Many happy returns.\" \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry. \n\n\"I require a private word with you,\" Scrimgeour went on. \"Also with Mr. Ronald \nWeasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\" \n\n\"Us?\" said Ron, sounding surprised. \"Why us?\" \n\n\"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Is \nthere such a place?' he demanded of Mr. Weasley. \n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \"The, er, sitting room, \nwhy don't you use that?\" \n\n\"You can lead the way,\" Scrimgeour said to Ron. \"There will be no need for you \nto accompany us, Arthur.\" \n\nHarry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, \nand Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew \nthat the other two were thinking the same as he was; Scrimgeour must, somehow, had \nlearned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. \n\nScrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into \nthe Burrow's sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, \n\n\f\nit was already dark in here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they \nilluminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair \nthat Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side \nby side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. \n\n\"I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it \nindividually. If you two\" -- he pointed at Harry and Hermione -- \"can wait upstairs, I will \nstart with Ronald.\" \n\n \n\n\"We're not going anywhere,\" said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \n\"You can speak to us together, or not at all.\" \n\nScrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the \nMinister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. \n\n\"Very well then, together,\" he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. \"I am here, \nas I'm sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will.\" \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. \n\n\"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you \nanything?\" \n\n\"A-all of us?\" said Ron, \"Me and Hermione too?\" \n\n\"Yes, all of --\" \n\nBut Harry interrupted. \n\n\"Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what \nhe left us?\" \n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \"They wanted \nto examine whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!\" she said, and her voice \ntrembled slightly. \n\n\"I had every right,\" said Scrimgeour dismissively. \"The Decree for Justifiable \nConfiscation gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will--\" \n\n\"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\" said Hermione, \n\"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions \nare illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was \ntrying to pass us something cursed?\" \n\n\"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\" asked \nScrimgeour. \n\n\"No, I'm not,\" retorted Hermione. \"I'm hoping to do some good in the world!\" \n\nRon laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry \nspoke. \n\n\"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext \nto keep them?\" \n\n\"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up,\" said Hermione at once. \"They can't \nkeep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?\" \n\n\"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?\" asked Scrimgeour, \nignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. \n\n\"Me? Not -- not really... It was always Harry who...\" \n\nRon looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-\ntalking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done; Scrimgeour looked as though he had \n\n\f\nheard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey \nupon Ron's answer. \n\n\"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that \nhe remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast \nmajority of his possessions -- his private library, his magical instruments, and other \npersonal effects -- were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\" \n\n\"I...dunno,\" said Ron. \"I...when I say we weren't close...I mean, I think he liked \nme...\" \n\n\"You're being modest, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Dumbledore was very fond of you.\" \n\nThis was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and \nDumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been \nnegligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his \ncloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. \nFrom it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. \n\n\"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... \nYes, here we are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that \nhe will remember me when he uses it.'\" \n\nScrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It looked \nsomething like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light \nfrom a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed \nthe Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. \n\n\"That is a valuable object,\" said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \"It may even be \nunique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you and item \nso rare?\" \n\nRon shook his head, looking bewildered. \n\n\"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\" Scrimgeour persevered. \n\"Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did \nhe think you would put to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?\" \n\n\"Put out lights, I s'pose,\" mumbled Ron. \"What else could I do with it?\" \n\nEvidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or \ntow, he turned back to Dumbledore's will. \n\n\"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the \nBard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'\" \n\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the \ncopy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. \nHermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and \ngazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes", "input_ids": [1, 931, 29871, 13, 5747, 750, 1539, 29892, 885, 1431, 1927, 322, 867, 326, 29889, 29871, 13, 13, 29908, 29903, 3818, 304, 11158, 1151, 1699, 1497,

VOLDEMORT\n\u3000\u3000Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock.\n\u3000\u3000\"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you....\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, you're making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this.... He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame werewolf --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\n\u3000\u3000BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\"\n\u3000\u3000Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w -- would it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if -- if there was a mistake --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.\n\u3000\u3000\"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I'll come quietly....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --\"\n\u3000\u3000What little color there was in Blacks face left it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You -you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\n\u3000\u3000Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOURE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You should have left him to me....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the right thing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Harry,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy -- give me Peter, please. Now.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one he's after if he was locked up in", "input_ids": [1, 375, 317, 1056, 412, 471, 28420, 1283, 278, 512, 28814, 27397, 557, 29892, 670, 24706, 13330, 29892, 4153, 472, 365, 786, 262, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 3210, 3301, 4945, 405,

in the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's my boy!\" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes!\" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. \"Yes! Yes!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done, Harry!\" said Percy, looking delighted. \"Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good for you, Harry!\" roared Seamus Finnigan.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ruddy brilliant!\" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was quite some Patronus,\" said a voice in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"The dementors didn't affect me at all!\" Harry said excitedly. \"I didn't feel a thing!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Come and see -- \"\n\u3000\u3000He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field.\n\u3000\u3000\"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"An unworthy trick!\" she was shouting. \"A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\"\n\u3000\u3000If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Harry!\" said George, fighting his way over. \"Party! Gryffindor common room, now!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did you do that?\" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" Fred muttered in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you even come to the match?\" he asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I did,\" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up. \"And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!\" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \"Anyway...\" She glanced over at Ron too. \"He doesn't want me to join in.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, \"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't you give her a break?\" Harry asked Ron quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron flatly. \"If she just acted like she was sorry -- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep....\n\u3000\u3000He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and -\n\u3000\u3000\"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of the room: \"What's going on?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?\" said Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!\"\n\u3000\u3000They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy voices called after them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who shouted?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was deserted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, I saw him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's all the noise?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!\"\n\u3000\u3000A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent, are we carrying on?\" said Fred Weasley brightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone back upstairs!\" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.\n\u3000\u3000\"Perce -- Sirius Black!\" said Ron faintly. \"In our dormitory!

Any questions?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood wasn't pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - \"\n\u3000\u3000*108*\n\u3000\u3000Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.\n\u3000\u3000Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.\n\u3000\u3000\"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged and still yawning, his team followed.\n\u3000\u3000They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood's been teaching us new moves.\"\n\u3000\u3000He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\n\u3000\u3000*io9*\n\u3000\u3000\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \"Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because they're here in person,\" said George, pointing.\n\u3000\u3000Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for today! We'll see about this!\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\"\n\u3000\u3000Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\"\n\u3000\u3000*110*\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.\"'\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\"\n\u3000\u3000And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.\n\u3000\u3000\"Funny you should mention Draco's father,\" said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team.\"\n\u3000\u3000All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors' noses in the early morning sun.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\"\n\u3000\u3000None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000*111*\n\u3000\u3000\"What's happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren't you playing? And what's he doing here?\"\n\u3000\u3000He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team.\n\u3000\u3000Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good, aren't they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin team howled with laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\"\n\u3000\u3000The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face.\n\u3000\u3000A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.\n\u3000\u300012\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch", "input_ids": [1, 471, 1790, 7613, 1090, 393, 29892, 322, 263, 4654, 1090, 393, 697, 29889, 10686, 269, 804, 964, 263, 15885, 272, 408, 10180, 270, 1617, 287, 373,

Presents!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.\n\u3000\u3000'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it,\" he said hoarsely.\n\u3000\u3000It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who sent it to you?\" said Ron in a hushed voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look and see if there's a card,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry, feeling stunned, \"I'm betting it wasn't the Dursleys.\"\n\u3000\u3000I bet it was Dumbledore,\" said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \"He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That was my dad's, though,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was just Passing it on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't go giving students stuff like this --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!\" said Ron. \"In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry\" -- Ron gave a great whoop of laughter -- \"Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't believe this,\" Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. \"Who -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" said Ron, controlling himself, \"I know who it could've been -- Lupin!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself \"Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but he likes you,\" said Ron. \"And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, he was away?\" said Harry. \"He was ill when I was playing in that match.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing,\" said Ron. \"I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry frowned at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't see Lupin affording something like this.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you two laughing about?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't bring him in here!\" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"There wasn't a card or anything with it.\"\n\u3000\u3000To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter with you?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" said Hermione slowly, \"but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron sighed exasperatedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the best broom there is, Hermione,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"So it must've been really expensive....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,\" said Ron happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they'd sent it?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who cares?\" said Ron impatiently. \"Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\" said Hermione shrilly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed, right at Ron's chest.\n\u3000\u3000\"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!\" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000I forgot about that!\" Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....\n\u3000\u3000The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\" said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe. \"Can't you shut that thing up?\" he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not looking too good, is he?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's stress!\" said Ron. \"He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died.\n\u3000\u3000Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory,", "input_ids": [1, 30358, 30358, 29908, 29949, 29891, 29991, 4360, 1237, 3850, 13, 30358, 30358, 21972, 719, 7450, 363, 670, 12917, 267, 322, 1925, 963,

bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened,\n\u3000\u3000* 2116 *\n\u3000\u3000the knuckles were bulging like bolts -his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small\n\u3000\u3000As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle's boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\n\u3000\u3000Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.\n\u3000\u3000Ron's door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe's flat nose. \"Unbelievable. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle's thick wrist. \"We've still got to find out\n\u3000\u3000* 217*\n\u3000\u3000where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione's door. \"C'mon, we need to go -\"\n\u3000\u3000A high-pitched voice answered him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - I don't think I'm going to come after all. You go on without me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode's ugly, no one's going to know it's you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No - really - I don't think I'll come. You two hurry up, you re wasting time\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at Ron, bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That's how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine - I'm fine - go on -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll meet you back here, all right?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How's this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, that's better . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was\n\u3000\u3000*218*\n\u3000\u3000a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.\n\u3000\u3000\"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We've forgotten the way to our common room.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I'm a Ravenclaw.\"\n\u3000\u3000She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe's and Goyle's huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn't going to be as easy as they had hoped.\n\u3000\u3000The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There's one of them now!\"\n\u3000\u3000The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn't a Slytherin, it was Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000Percy looked affronted.\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It's Crabbe, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u30002 19\n\u3000\u3000\"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It's not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You are,\" Ron pointed out.\n\u3000\u3000\"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing's about to attack me.\"\n\u3000\u3000A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I've been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what're you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered.\n\u3000\u3000Percy looked outraged.\n\u3000\u3000\"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"I don't like your attitude!\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed.\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\n\u3000\u3000* 220 *\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the new password again?\" he said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him.\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry

\nmatter-of-fact tone in which he said them. \n\n \u201cThe only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the \noutside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit \n\n\f\ntoo outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for \nChristmas.\u201d \n\n \u201cNeville, she\u2019s all right, we\u2019ve seen her \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.\u201d \n\n From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the \nfake Galleons that Dumbledore\u2019s Army had used to send one another messages. \n\n \u201cThese have been great,\u201d said Neville, beaming at Hermione. \u201cThe Carrows never \nrumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night \nand put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore\u2019s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape \nhated it.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou used to?\u201d said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. \n\n \u201cWell, it got more difficult as time went one,\u201d said Neville. \u201cWe lost Luna at \nChristmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the \nleaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming \ndown on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year \nthey\u2019d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo kidding,\u201d muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. \n\n \u201cYeah, well, I couldn\u2019t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped \nthose kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a \ncouple of weeks ago. That\u2019s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I \nsuppose, and they went for Gran.\u201d \n\n \u201cThey what?\u201d said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so \nsteeply, \u201cwell, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to \nforce their relatives to behave. I s\u2019pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the \nother way around. Thing was,\u201d he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he \nwas grinning, \u201cthey bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch \nliving alone, they probably thought hey didn\u2019t need to send anyone particularly powerful. \nAnyway,\u201d Neville laughed, \u201cDawlish is still in St. Mungo\u2019s and Gran\u2019s on the run. She \nsent me a letter,\u201d he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, \u201ctelling me she was \nproud of me, that I\u2019m my parent\u2019s son, and to keep it up.\u201d \n\n \u201cCool,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cYea,\u201d said Neville happily. \u201cOnly thing was, once they realized they had no hold \nover me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don\u2019t know whether they \nwere planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to \ndisappear.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut,\u201d said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, \u201caren\u2019t \u2013 aren\u2019t we heading \nstraight back for Hogwarts?\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. We\u2019re here.\u201d \n\n They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another \nshort flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana\u2019s portrait. Neville \npushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for \nunseen people: \n\n \u201cLook who it is! Didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d \n\n As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams \nand yells: \u201cHARRY!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Potter, it\u2019s POTTER!\u201d \u201cRon!\u201d \u201cHermione!\u201d \n\n\f\n He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The \nnext moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their \nhair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They \nmight have just won a Quidditch final. \n\n \u201cOkay, okay, calm down!\u201d Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry \nwas able to take in their surroundings. \n\n He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the \ninterior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship\u2019s cabin. \nMulticolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran \naround the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright \ntapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black \nbadger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. \nThe silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few \nbroomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-cased wireless. \n\n \u201cWhere are we?\u201d \n\n \u201cRoom of Requirement, of course!\u201d said Neville. \u201cSurpassed itself, hasn\u2019t it? The \nCarrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to \nget through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly like this when I \narrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. \nBut it\u2019s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd the Carrows can\u2019t get in?\u201d asked Harry, looking around for the door. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: \nSeamus\u2019s face was bruised and puffy. \u201cIt\u2019s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in \nhere, they can\u2019t get at us, the door won\u2019t open. It\u2019s all down to Neville. He really gets this \nroom. You\u2019ve got to ask for exactly what you need \u2013 like, \u201cI don\u2019t want any Carrow \nsupporters to be able to get in\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019ll do it for you! You\u2019ve just got to make sure you \nclose the loopholes. Neville\u2019s the man!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s quite straightforward, really,\u201d said Neville modestly. \u201cI\u2019d been in here about \na day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and \nthat\u2019s when the passage to Hog\u2019s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. \nHe\u2019s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that\u2019s the one thing the room \ndoesn\u2019t really do. \n\n \u201cYeah, well, food\u2019s one of the five exceptions to Gamp\u2019s Law of Elemental \nTransfiguration,\u201d said Ron to general astonishment. \n\n \u201cSo we\u2019ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\u201d said Seamus, \u201cand it just \nmakes more hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good \nbathroom once girls started turning up \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201c\u2014and thought they\u2019d quite like to wash, yes,\u201d supplied Lavender Brown, whom \nHarry had not noticed until that point.

He couldn't see. He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .\n\u3000\u3000And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him -\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000Someone was slapping his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"W -- what?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you okay?\" Ron asked nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature had vanished. \"What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one screamed,\" said Ron, more nervously still.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I heard screaming --\"\n\u3000\u3000A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here,\" he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \"Eat it. It'll help.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that thing?\" he asked Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"A dementor,\" said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. \"One of the dementors of Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat,\" he repeated. \"It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me...\n\u3000\u3000He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?\" said Hermione, watching Harry anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I Don't get it.... What happened?\" said Harry, wiping more sweat off his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought you were having a fit or something,\" said Ron, who still looked scared. \"You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching -- 11\n\u3000\u3000\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, 'None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... \"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was horrible,\" said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \"Did YOU feel how cold it got when it came in?\"\n\u3000\u3000I felt weird,\" said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \"Like I'd never be cheerful again....\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her.\n\u3000\u3000\"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?\" said Harry awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \"Ginny was shaking like mad, though....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, \"I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you know....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Are you all right, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" he muttered, embarrassed.\n\u3000\u3000They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets.\n\u3000\u3000\"Firs' years this way!\" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\n\u3000\u3000The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.\n\u3000\u3000As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy fainted?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously. \"Shove off, Malfoy,\" said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you faint as well, Weasley?\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Did the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is there a problem?\" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, \"Oh, no -- er -- Professor,\" then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.\n\u3000\u3000The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter! Granger", "input_ids": [1, 29889, 940, 8496, 29915, 29873, 1074, 29889, 940, 471, 270, 798, 1076, 297, 11220, 29889, 1670, 471, 263, 364, 21616, 297, 670, 22827, 408, 2466, 310, 4094, 29889, 940, 471,

way.\n\u3000\u3000\"But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey Dukes.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's this sweetshop,\" said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, \"where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at the mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you're thinking what to write next --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?\" Hermione pressed on eagerly. \"In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you're sucking them,\" said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked around at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Spect it will,\" said Harry heavily. \"You'll have to tell me when You've found out.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn't either.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked horrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"\"You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone will give you permission -- \" musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, look who it is,\" said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door. \"Potty and the Weasel.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,\" said Malfoy. \"Did your mother die of shock?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he spotted Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back. \"What were you saying, Malfoy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,\" he said angrily. \"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to get hold of his head and --\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron made a violent gesture in midair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, \"be careful...\"\n\u3000\u3000But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.\n\u3000\u3000The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.\n\u3000\u3000\"We must be nearly there,\" said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.\n\u3000\u3000The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Great,\" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. \"I'm starving. I want to get to the feast....\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't be there yet,\" said Hermione, checking her watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"So why're we stopping?\"\n\u3000\u3000The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments.\n\u3000\u3000The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.\n\u3000\u3000\"'What's going on?\" said Ron's voice from behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" gasped Hermione. \"Ron, that was my foot!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his way back to his seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think we've broken down?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno...\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something moving out there,\" Ron said. \"I think people are coming aboard....\"\n\u3000\u3000The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry's legs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry\n\u3000\u3000\"Hullo, Neville,\" said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea -- sit down --\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on,\" came Hermione's voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I was looking for Ron --\" \"Come in and sit down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not here!\" said Harry hurriedly. \"I'm here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" said Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quiet!\" said a hoarse voice suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear movements in his corner.\n\u3000\u3000None of them spoke.\n\u3000\u3000There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and wary.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stay where you are,\" he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.\n\u3000\u3000Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water...\n\u3000\u3000But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak.\n\u3000\u3000And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.\n\u3000\u3000An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart....\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes rolled up into his head", "input_ids": [1, 376, 29902, 29915, 345, 1303, 372, 29915, 29879, 278, 871, 9186, 1661,

A wave of piercing cold broke over him --\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto --\"\n\u3000\u3000But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.... Harry was failing again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head -- \"Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll do anything!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what had happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry,\" he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you all right?\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes...\" Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here --\" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. \"Eat this before we try again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's getting worse,\" Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. \"I could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked paler than usual. ,\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I do!\" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth. \"I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right then... \" said Lupin. \"You might want to select 'other memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn't seem to have been strong enough....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" said Lupin, gripping the box lid.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready,\" said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go!\" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry -\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --\"\n\u3000\u3000White fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around him... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --\n\u3000\u3000\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --\"\n\u3000\u3000The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a cackle of high- pitched laughter --\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry... wake up....\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard my dad,\" Harry mumbled. \"That's the first time I've ever heard him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.\n\u3000\u3000\"You heard James?\" said Lupin in a strange voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\" Face dry, Harry looked up. \"Why -- you didn't know my dad, did you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- I did, as a matter of fact,\" said Lupin. \"We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggested putting you through this....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry. He got up again. \"I'll have one more go! I'm not thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on....\"\n\u3000\u3000He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus...\n\u3000\u3000The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he didn't know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment. \"Concentrating hard? All right -- go!\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark\n\u3000\u3000'EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" Harry bellowed. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"\n\u3000\u3000The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer and louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how much longer, he wasn't sure --\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" roared Lupin, springing forward.\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent!\" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \"Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can we have another go? Just one more go?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not now,\" said Lupin firmly. \"You've had enough for one night. Here --\"\n\u3000\u3000He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin?\" he said. \"If you knew my dad, you must've known Sirius Black as well.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin turned very quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What gives you that idea?\" he said sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too....\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's face relaxed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I knew him,\" he said shortly. \"Or I thought I did. You'd better be off, Harry, it's getting late.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts wandered back to his mother and father...\n\u3000\u3000He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again....\n\u3000\u3000\"They're dead,\" he told himself sternly. \"", "input_ids": [1, 10686, 29892, 11580,

upon which \nhe became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a \nclose friend. \n\n\u201cAnd, of course, you \u2018ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!\u201d said Monsieur \nDelacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of \npure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw \nHarry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. \n\n\u201cWell, come in, do!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours \ninto the house, with many \u201cNo, please!\u201ds and \u201cAfter you!\u201ds and \u201cNot at all!\u201ds. \n\nThe Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were \npleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. \nMonsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids\u2019 \nshoes \u201cCharmant!\u201d Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and \nhad the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying \nto assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French. \n\n\f\nOn the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. \nand Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur \nand Madame Delacour\u2019s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was \nsleeping with Fleur in Percy\u2019s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best \nman, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became \nvirtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to \nvolunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. \n\n\u201cBut she still won\u2019t leave us alone!\u201d snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a \nmeeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket \nof laundry in her arms. \n\n\u201cOh, good, you\u2019ve fed the chickens,\u201d she called as she approached them. \u201cWe\u2019d \nbetter shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the \nwedding,\u201d she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. \n\u201cMillamant\u2019s Magic Marquees . . . they\u2019re very good. Bill\u2019s escorting them. . . . You\u2019d \nbetter stay inside while they\u2019re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a \nwedding, having all these security spells around the place.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Harry humbly. \n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, dear!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley at once. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2013 well, your \nsafety\u2019s much more important! Actually, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you how you want to \ncelebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it\u2019s an important day. . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a fuss,\u201d said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this \nwould put on them all. \u201cReally, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It\u2019s \nthe day before the wedding. . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, well, if you\u2019re sure, dear. I\u2019ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how \nabout Hagrid?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut please, don\u2019t go to loads of trouble.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot at all, not at all . . . It\u2019s no trouble. . . .\u201d \n\nShe looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened \nup, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and \nthe damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great \nwave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Seven \n\n The Will of Albus Dumbledore \n\n \n\nHe was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn. Far below, \nswathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the \nman he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the \nanswer to his problem...? \n\n\"Oi, wake up.\" \n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron's dingy attic \nroom. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep \nwith his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. \n\n\f\n\"You were muttering in your sleep.\" \n\n\"Was I?\" \n\n\"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'\" \n\nHarry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. \n\n\"Who's Gregorovitch?\" \n\n \n\n\"I dunno, do I?\" You were the one saying it.\" \n\nHarry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name \nbefore, but he could not think where. \n\n\"I think Voldemort's looking for him.\" \n\n\"Poor bloke,\" said Ron fervently. \n\nHarry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember \nexactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon \nand the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. \n\n\"I think he's abroad.\" \n\n\"Who, Gregorovitch?\" \n\n\"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't \nlook like anywhere in Britain.\" \n\n\"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?\" \n\nRon sounded worried. \n\n\"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione,\" said Harry. \"Although how she expects \nme to stop seeing stuff in my sleep...\" \n\nHe gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking...Why was the name \n\"Gregorovitch\" familiar? \n\n\"I think,\" he said slowly, \"he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some \nconnection, but I can't--I can't think what it is.\" \n\n\"Quidditch?\" said Ron. \"Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?\" \n\n\"Who?\" \n\n\"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record \nfee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.\" \n\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.\" \n\n \n\n\"I try not to either,\" said Ron. \"Well, happy birthday anyway.\" \n\n\"Wow -- that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!\" \n\nHarry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk \nwhere he had left his glasses, and said, \"Accio Glasses!\" Although they were only around \na foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward \nhim, at least until they poked him in the eye. \n\n\"Slick,\" snorted Ron. \n\nReveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around \nthe room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry \nalso tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes \nto untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's \nChudley Cannons posters bright blue. \n\n\f\n\"I'd do your fly by hand, though,\" Ron ad", "input_ids": [1, 1334, 294, 2330, 4846, 263, 767, 423, 1052, 10569, 29936, 6285, 29889, 1334, 294, 2330, 18318, 1075,

beard?\u201d \n\n Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. \n\n A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring \nbroken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the \naisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of \namethyst colored robes with a matching hat. \n\n A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both \nwearing dress robes, with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and \nthere was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as \nmusic swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. \n\n \u201cOoooh!\u201d said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. \n\n A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as \nMonsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur \nDelacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and \nseemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed \neveryone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and \nGabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur \nhad reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. \n\n\f\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, \nHarry saw the same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, \nnow standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \u201cWe are gathered here today to celebrate the \nunion of two faithful souls\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,\u201d said Auntie Muriel in a rather \ncarrying whisper. \u201cBut I must say, Ginevra\u2019s dress is far too low cut.\u201d \n\n Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front \nagain. Harry\u2019s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons \nspent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; \nthey had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours \nfrom a normal person\u2019s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead\u2026. \n\n \u201cDo you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle\u2026?\u201d \n\n In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly \ninto scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that \nHagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned \naround and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. \n\n \u201c\u2026then I declare you bonded for life.\u201d \n\n The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and \na shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As \nFred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of \nparadise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and \nchimes to the din. \n\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d called the tufty-haired wizard. \u201cIf you would please \nstand up!\u201d \n\n They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The \nscars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the \nmarquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a \nglorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten \ngold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering \nchairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated \ngracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium. \n\n \u201cSmooth,\u201d said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some \nhearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of \ntarts and sandwiches. \n\n \u201cWe should go and congratulate them!\u201d said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see \nthe place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have time later,\u201d shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing \ntray and handing one to Harry. \u201cHermione, cop hold, let\u2019s grab a table\u2026. Not there! \nNowhere near Muriel \u2013\u201c \n\n Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; \nHarry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached \nthe other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one \nwhere Luna sat alone. \n\n \u201cAll right if we join you?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said happily. \u201cDaddy\u2019s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our \npresent.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat is it, a lifetime\u2019s supply of Gurdyroots?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes \nwatering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. \n\n The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great \napplause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by \nMr. Weasley and Fleur\u2019s father. \n\n \u201cI like this song,\u201d said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few \nseconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the \nspot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s great isn\u2019t she?\u201d said Ron admiringly. \u201cAlways good value.\u201d \n\n But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into \nLuna\u2019s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not \ncome to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \u201cWho is that man in the \nyellow?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s Xenophilius Lovegood, he\u2019s the father of a friend of ours,\u201d said Ron. His \npugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the \nclear provocation. \u201cCome and dance,\u201d he added abruptly to Hermione. \n\n She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into \nthe growing throng on the dance floor. \n\n \u201cAh, they are together now?\u201d asked Krum, momentarily distracted. \n\n \u201cEr \u2013 sort of,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d Krum asked. \n\n \u201cBarny Weasley.\u201d \n\n They shook hands. \n\n \u201cYou, Barny \u2013 you know this man Lovegood well?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I only met him today. Why?\u201d \n\n Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting \nto several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. \n\n \u201cBecause,\u201d said Krum, \u201cIf he vus not a guest of Fleur\u2019s I vould dud him, here and \nnow, for veering that filthy sign upon his chest.\u201d \n\n \u201cSign?\u201d said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye \nwas gleaming on his chest. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d \n\n \u201cGrindelvald. That is Grindelvald\u2019s sign.\u201d \n\n \u201cGrindelwald\u2026", "input_ids": [1, 13, 29885, 290, 1237, 540, 5478, 25396, 304, 10686, 29892, 1346, 9260, 366, 1074, 540, 30010, 29879, 21633, 263,

Of course, he thought bitterly, Un cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talk ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills).\n\u3000\u3000\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia, you will be -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good, good. And Dudley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. \"And you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry tonelessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eight- fifteen -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000\"And, Dudley, you'll say -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\n\u3000\u3000\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Perfect. . . Dudley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"'\n\u3000\u3000This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you, boy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Ma sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way. When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow. Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. \"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\" Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: \"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . . No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the\n\u3000\u3000Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.\n\u3000\u3000What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....\n\u3000\u3000Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\n\u3000\u3000The huge eyes blinked and vanished.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of the week.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said Harry coolly.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why're you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\n\u3000\u3000\"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - you haven't got any friends to take you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor\n\u3000\u3000the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.\n\u3000\u3000While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, was",

wandering around this late, Tom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year- younger Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\n\u3000\u3000But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\n\u3000\u3000*2 45 *\n\u3000\u3000see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\n\u3000\u3000It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.\n\u3000\u3000Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard.\n\u3000\u3000For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000There was something familiar about that voice ....\n\u3000\u3000Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply.\n\u3000\u3000The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\n\u3000\u3000\"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle stepped closer.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\"\n\u3000\u30004 6\n\u3000\u3000\"N\" at d'yeh -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn't him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn'! He never!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone\n\u3000\u3000A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NO000000!\"\n\u3000\u3000The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000*24 7*\n\u3000\u3000Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three- headed dog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.\n\u3000\u3000Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what\n\u3000\u3000he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron tried a different tack.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame him for wanting to stay here ......\n\u3000\u3000\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That'd be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"'\n\u3000\u3000In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became\n\u3000\u3000hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment they start trying to move into each other", "input_ids": [1, 7450, 278, 19546, 12713, 29892, 746, 263, 15655, 281, 17909, 411, 1472,

the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.\n\u3000\u3000Weasleys'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.\n\u3000\u3000\"--makes no sense not to tell him,\" Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He's thirteen years old and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \"Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\" retorted Mr. Weasley. \"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves -- they've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But Harry mustn't do that this year! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn't picked him up, I'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the point\n\u3000\u3000\"Molly, they say Sirius Black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible. It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black's after\n\u3000\u3000\"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry\n\u3000\u3000There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You- Know-Who, and he's had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn't happy about it, but he agreed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not happy? Why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch Black?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather avoid.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them, said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"It's late, Molly, we'd better go up....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's room in search of his badge.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got it,\" Fred whispered to Harry. \"We've been improving it.\"\n\u3000\u3000The badge now read Bighead Boy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed.\n\u3000\u3000So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He'd made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?\n\u3000\u3000And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed very remote.\n\u3000\u3000No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.\n\u3000\u3000He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn't look after himself? He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn't completely useless....\n\u3000\u3000Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to be murdered,\" Harry said out loud.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's the spirit, dear,\" said his mirror sleepily.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FIVE\n\u3000\u3000THE DEMENTOR\n\u3000\u3000Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.\n\u3000\u3000\"The sooner we get on the train, the better,\" he said. \"At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,\" Ron grimaced, \"his girlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got something to tell you,\" Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.\n\u3000\u3000They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you saying?\" Ron asked Harry as they sat down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had no chance to speak to Ron", "input_ids": [1, 1497, 304, 11546, 29892, 322, 540, 3512, 1623, 303, 7121, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 21972, 719, 471, 4203, 1582, 3412, 278, 13382, 304, 278, 2594, 29892, 607,

the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red- eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly' and \"looking happy.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\n\u3000\u3000\"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her bracingly. \"Honestly, we're much better off without her.\" Ginny's lip trembled. \"Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron assured her. \"They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. I'm only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\n\u3000\u3000The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming\n\u3000\u3000*146*\n\u3000\u3000toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.\n\u3000\u3000Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long composition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European\n\u3000\u3000Wizards.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short\tsaid Ron fu\n\u3000\u3000riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's tiny. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.\n\u3000\u3000\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk about Lockhart being so great -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.\n\u3000\u3000\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there's a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why do you want it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000*141*\n\u3000\u3000\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's just it. I can't remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And I can't find the story anywhere else -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately, checking his watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I won't,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You've had ten days to finish it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.\n\u3000\u3000History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\n\u3000\u3000Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec\n\u3000\u3000*148*\n\u3000\u3000ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss - er -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice.\n\u3000\u3000Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers\n\u3000\u3000\"\n\u3000\u3000He stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Grant?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I suppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"\n\u3000\u3000But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry\n\u3000\u3000*149*\n\u3000\u3000could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ...\n\u3000\u3000\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"\n\u3000\u3000He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\n\u3000\u3000\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to", "input_ids": [1, 11147, 1699, 1497, 10686, 29889, 376, 4806, 29915, 29881, 2253, 679, 304, 6592, 1434, 317, 1056, 412, 5304, 3412,

I thought we were both goners.\" \n\n \"Yeah, me too. I can't believe \u2013\" \n\n Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind \nHagrid. \n\n \"You!\" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. \n\n \"Your wand's here, son,\" said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. \"It fell right beside \nyou, I picked it up\u2026And that's my wife you're shouting at.\" \n\n \"Oh, I'm \u2013 I'm sorry.\" \n\n As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister \nBellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light\u2019s oft brown and her eyes \nwere wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's \nexclamation. \n\n \"What happened to our daughter?\" she asked. \"Hagrid said you were ambushed; \nwhere is Nymphadora?\" \n\n \"I don't know,\" said Harry. \"We don't know what happened to anyone else.\" \n\n\f\n She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the \nsight of their expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He \nhad consented to the plan, given them his hair . . . \n\n \"The Portkey,\" he said, remembering all of a sudden. \"We've got to get back to \nthe Burrow and find out \u2013 then we'll be able to send you word, or \u2013 or Tonks will, once \nshe's \u2013\" \n\n \"Dora'll be ok, 'Dromeda,\" said Ted. \"She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of \ntight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here,\" he added to Harry. \"It's \nsupposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.\" \n\n \"Yeah, we do,\" said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. \"I \n\u2013\" \n\n He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he \nleft her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he \ndid not seem hollow and insincere. \n\n \"I'll tell Tonks \u2013 Dora \u2013 to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, \nthanks for everything, I \u2013\" \n\n He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and \ninto a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the \ndoor lintel. \n\n \"There you go, son. That's the Portkey.\" \n\n Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing \ntable. \n\n \"Thanks,\" said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. \n\n \"Wait a moment,\" said Hagrid, looking around. \"Harry, where's Hedwig?\" \n\n \"She . . . she got hit,\" said Harry. \n\n The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung \nhis eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world \nwhenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys. \n\n Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. \n\n \"Never mind,\" he said gruffly, \"Never mind. She had a great old life \u2013\" \n\n \"Hagrid!\" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and \nHagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time. \n\n With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged \nhim forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued \nto the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet \nslammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. \nHe heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, \nswaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back \ndoor as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet. \n\n \"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?\" cried \nMrs. Weasley. \n\n \"What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?\" Harry panted. \n\n The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. \n\n \"The Death Eaters were waiting for us,\" Harry told her, \"We were surrounded the \nmoment we took off \u2013 they knew it was tonight \u2013 I don't know what happened to anyone \n\n\f\nelse, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort \ncaught up with us \u2013\" \n\n He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand \nwhy he did not know what had happened to her sons, but \u2013 \n\n \"Thank goodness you're all right,\" she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel \nhe deserved. \n\n \"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?\" asked Hagrid a little shakily, \"Fer \nmedicinal purposes?\" \n\n She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the \ncrooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she \nanswered his unspoken plea for information at once. \n\n \"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it \ncame back without them,\" she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. \n\"And that one,\" she pointed at an ancient sneaker, \"should have been Dad and Fred's, \nthey were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,\" she checked her \nwatch, \"if they made it, George and Lupin aught to be back in about a minute.\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. \nHe uncorked it and drank it straight down in one. \n\n \"Mum!\" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. \n\n A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin \nand George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was \nsomething wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face \nwas covered in blood. \n\n Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried \nGeorge into the house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on \nthe sofa. As the lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach \nlurched: One of George's ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched \nin wet, shockingly scarlet blood. \n\n No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the \nupper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was \nstill attempting to ease his bulk through the back door. \n\n \"Oi!\" said Hagrid indignantly, \"Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!\" \n\n Lupin ignored him. \n\n \"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office \nat Hogwarts?\" he said, giving Harry a small shake. \"Answer me!\" \n\n \"A \u2013 a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?\" \n\n Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. \n\n \"Wha' was tha' about?\" roared Hagrid. \n\n \"I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check,\" said Lupin tersely. \"We've been betrayed. \nVoldemort knew that you were being moved tonight", "input_ids": [1, 29892, 10686, 29892, 920, 1258, 8007, 29882, 679, 714, 288, 29915,

If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open up,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do.\n\u3000\u3000*300*\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going down there,\" he said. .\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me too,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. \"I'll just -\"\n\u3000\u3000He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled.\n\u3000\u3000White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.\n\u3000\u3000\"I really don't think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go.\n\u3000\u3000It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\n\u3000\u3000And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\n\u3000\u3000*301\n\u3000\u3000feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.\n\u3000\u3000\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls.\n\u3000\u3000All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.\n\u3000\u3000The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....\n\u3000\u3000But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\n\u3000\u3000* 302 *\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high.\n\u3000\u3000The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly.\n\u3000\u3000There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's knees had given way.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate!\"\n\u3000\u3000The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm here!\" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'm okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='\n\u3000\u3000*303*\n\u3000\u3000There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.\n\u3000\u3000\"What now?\" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through - it'll take ages ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in?\n\u3000\u3000There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on.... If I'm not back in an hour. . .\n\u3000\u3000There was a very pregnant pause,\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice.\n\u3000\u3000And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\n\u3000\u3000Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\n\u3000\u3000*304*\n\u3000\u3000Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\n\u3000\u3000He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\n\u3000\u3000The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.\n\u3000\u3000e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber.

Ariana \n\ncouldn't control it. But my mother was killed.\" \n\n Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any \nmore, but Aberforth kept talking, \n\nand Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in \nfact, he had ever spoken about it. \n\n \"So that put paid to Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of 'em \ncame home for my mother's \n\nfuneral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. \nHa!\" \n\n Aberforth spat into the fire. \n\n \"I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed \nhome and done it. \n\nHe told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a \ncomedown for Mr. Brilliant, \n\nthere's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house \nevery other day. But he \n\ndid all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.\" \n\n And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth\u2019s face. \n\n \"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as \nbright and talented he was. And \n\nlooking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a \nnew Wizarding order and looking \n\nfor Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the \nbenefit of all Wizardkind, and if one \n\nyoung girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater \ngood? \n\n \"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go \nhack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, \n\nboth of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, \nand it took a little imagination to \n\nsee him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \"I told him, you'd \nbetter give it up now. You can't move her, \n\n\f\nshe's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, \nwhen you're making your clever speeches, \n\ntrying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that.\" said Aberforth, and his \neyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on \n\nthe lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn't like that \nat all. He got angry. He told me what a \n\nstupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . \nDidn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't \n\nhave to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and \ntaught the Muggles their place? \n\n \"And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and \nI had the Cruciatus Curse used on \n\nme by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us \nwere dueling, and the flashing lights \n\nand the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it - \" \n\n The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal \nwound. \n\n \" - and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, \nand I don't know which of us did it, \n\nit could have been any of us - and she was dead.\" \n\n His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. \nHermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron \n\nwas almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not \nheard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. \n\n \"I'm so . . . I'm so sorry,\" Hermione whispered. \n\n \"Gone,\" croaked Aberforth. \"Gone forever.\" \n\n He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. \n\n \" 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in \nhis own country, and he didn't want Ariana \n\nset to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, \nfree to become the greatest wizard of the - \" \n\n \"He was never free,\" said Harry. \n\n \"I beg your pardon?\" said Aberforth. \n\n \"Never,\" said Harry. \"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that \ndrove him out of his mind. He started screaming, \n\npleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.' \" \n\n Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about \nwhat had happened on the island on the lake: \n\nThe events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had \neclipsed it so thoroughly. \n\n \"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\" said \nHarry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. \n\n\"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to \nhim, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.\" \n\n Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. \nAfter a long pause he said. \"How can you be sure, Potter, \n\n\f\nthat my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be \nsure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?\" \n\n A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart. \n\n \"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\" said Hermione. \n\n \"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. \"Why didn't he say to \nhim, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?\" \n\n \"Because,\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \"sometimes you've got to \nthink about more than your own safety! Sometimes \n\nyou've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\" \n\n \"You're seventeen, boy!\" \n\n \"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\" \n\n \"Who says I've given up?\" \n\n \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\" Harry repeated, \"You-Know-Who's won, \nit's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding \n\nthemselves.\" \n\n \"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!\" \n\n \"No, it isn't.\" said Harry. \"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and \nhe passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going \n\nuntil I succeed - or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for \nyears.\" \n\n He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. \n\n \"We need to get into Hogwarts,\" said Harry again. \"If you can't help us, we'll wait \ntill daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way \n\nin ourselves. If you can help us - well, now would be a great time to mention it.\" \n\n Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so \nextraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his \n\nthroat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. \n\n \"You know what to do,\"", "input_ids": [1, 29892, 322, 590, 5637, 9007,

Unwrap it up here, it's not for my mother's \neyes.\" \n\n\"A book?\" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. \"Bit of a departure from \ntradition, isn't it?\" \n\n\"This isn't your average book,\" said Ron. \"It'd pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways \nto Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this \nlast year I'd have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to \nget going with... Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot. You'd be \nsurprised, it's not all about wandwork, either.\" \n\nWhen they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. \nBill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood \nchatting to them over the frying pan. \n\n \n\n\"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \nbeaming at him. \"He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our \npresent on top.\" \n\nHarry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. \nInside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his \nseventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the race instead of hands. \n\n\"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,\" said Mrs. \nWeasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. \"I'm afraid that one isn't new \nlike Ron's, it was actually my brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his \npossessions, it's a bit dented on the back, but--\" \n\nThe rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put \na lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted \nhis cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, \ncausing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. \n\n\"Happy birthday, Harry!\" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her \nown present to the top of the pile. \"It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get \nhim?\" she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her. \n\n\"Come on, then, open Hermione's!\" said Ron. \n\nShe had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an \nenchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (\"Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you \nwill ever 'ave,\" Monsieur Delacour assured him, \"but you must tell it clearly what you \nwant...ozzerwise you might find you 'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...\"), \nchocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys' Wizard \nWheezes merchandise from Fred and George. \n\n \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame \nDelacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. \n\n\"I'll pack these for you,\" Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his \narms as the three of them headed back upstairs. \"I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the \nrest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron--\" \n\nRon's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. \n\n\"Harry, will you come in here a moment?\" \n\n\f\nIt was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow \nand tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. \n\nHe had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large \nposter of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog \nJones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A \ndesk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and \nGinny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now \nhoused a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny's \nwindow. \n\nGinny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, \"Happy \nseventeenth.\" \n\n\"Yeah...thanks.\" \n\nShe was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; \nit was like gazing into a brilliant light. \n\n\"Nice view,\" he said feebly, pointing toward with window. \n\nShe ignored this. He could not blame her. \n\n\"I couldn't think what to get you,\" she said. \n\n \n\n\"You didn't have to get me anything.\" \n\nShe disregarded this too. \n\n\"I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn't be \nable to take it with you.\" \n\nHe chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many \nwonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that \nhaving six brothers must have toughened her up. \n\nShe took a step closer to him. \n\n\"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, \nif you meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing.\" \n\n\"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be \nhonest.\" \n\n\"There's the silver lining I've been looking for,\" she whispered, and then she was \nkissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it \nwas blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, \nGinny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-- \n\nThe door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. \n\n\"Oh,\" said Ron pointedly. \"Sorry.\" \n\n\"Ron!\" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained \nsilence, then Ginny had said in a flat little voice, \n\n\"Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.\" \n\nRon's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door \nin their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door \nopened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for \nending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk \ninside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. \n\n\f\nHe looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but \nshe had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to \ntears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. \n\n\"I'll see you later,\" he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. \n\nRon marched downstairs, though the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and \nHarry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking \nscared. \n\nOnce he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. \n\n\"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?\" \n\n\"I'm not messing her around,\" said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. \n\n\"Ron--\" \n\nBut Ron held up a hand to silence her. \n\n",

It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had \nno knowledge. As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, \nsentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of \n\n\f\nfiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and \nthe detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their \nfanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. \n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione \nstopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and \nhorns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. \n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d \n\n\u201cHere!\u201d \n\nHarry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk \nand threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg \nover the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, \nmissing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The \nsmoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was \nconsuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a \nthousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in \nthe room. Harry couldnot see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped \nas low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was \nnothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . . \n\n\u201cHarry, let\u2019s get out, let\u2019s get out!\u201d bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see \nwhere the door was through the black smoke. \n\nAnd then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible \ncommotion, the thunder of devouring flame. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 too \u2013 dangerous \u2013 !\u201d Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses \ngiving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, \nseeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . . \n\nAnd he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair \nof them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him \ncoming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no \ngood. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy\u2019s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of \nHarry\u2019s \u2013 \n\n\u201cIF WE DIE FOR THEM, I\u2019LL KILL YOU, HARRY!\u201d roared Ron\u2019s voice, and, \nas a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto \ntheir broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up \nbehind Harry. \n\n\u201cThe door, get to the door, the door!\u201d screamed Malfoy in Harry\u2019s ear, and Harry \nsped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly \nable to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring \nflames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in \ncelebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara \u2013 \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, what are you doing, the door\u2019s that way!\u201d screamed Malfoy, \nbut Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, \nturning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he \nhad it, caught it around his wrist \u2013 \n\nHarry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight \ntoward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had \n\n\f\nvanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the \nsmoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and \nmoments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor \nbeyond. \n\nMalfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. \nHarry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and \nRon and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. \n\n\u201cC-Crabbe,\u201d choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. \u201cC-Crabbe . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d said Ron harshly. \n\nThere was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge \nbangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on \nhorses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet \nwhen the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all \naround him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared \nwithin him. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ginny?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cShe was here. She was supposed to be going \nback into the Room of Requirement.\u201d \n\n\u201cBlimey, d\u2019you reckon it\u2019ll still work after that fire?\u201d asked Ron, but he too got to \nhis feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. \u201cShall we split up and look \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained \nslumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. \u201cLet\u2019s stick \ntogether. I say we go \u2013 Harry, what\u2019s that on your arm?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat? Oh yeah \u2013\u201c \n\nHe pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with \nsoot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched \nupon it; WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN\u2019S GREATEST TREASURE. \n\nA

{"text": "new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.\n\u3000\u3000No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks\n\u3000\u3000* 2:L2 *\n\u3000\u3000about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.\n\u3000\u3000\"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\" said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I don't think -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That could go seriously wrong -\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.\n\u3000\u3000\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\" she said sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\"\n\u3000\u3000*213*\n\u3000\u3000\"I've already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.\"\n\u3000\u3000When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\"\n\u3000\u3000But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.\n\u3000\u3000\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore\n\u3000\u3000* _2 14 *\n\u3000\u3000head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n\u3000\u3000They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny- faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry showed her Goyle's hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \"You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.\"\n\u3000\u3000The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure I've done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" Ron whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass.\n\u3000\u3000*215*\n\u3000\u3000The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We'll take separate stalls.\"\n\u3000\u3000Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" he called.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready,\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices.\n\u3000\u3000\"One - two - three -\"\n\u3000\u3000Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.\n\u3000\u3000Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he'd just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a

tut\u2026 even here, in the heart of the \nMinistry!\u201d She stepped into the lift besides Hermione, as did the two wizards who had \nbeen listening to Umbridge\u2019s conversation with the Minister. \u201cWe\u2019ll go straight down, \nMafalda, you\u2019ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren\u2019t \nyou getting out?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Harry in Runcorn\u2019s deep voice. \n\n Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. \nGlancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione\u2019s anxious face sinking back out of sight, \na tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge\u2019s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. \n\n \u201cWhat brings you here, Runcorn?\u201d asked the new Minister of Magic. His long \nblack hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead \nshadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath \na rock. \n\n\f\n \u201cNeeded a quick word with,\u201d Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, \u201cArthur \nWeasley. Someone said he was up on level one.\u201d \n\n \u201cAh,\u201d said Plum Thicknesse. \u201cHas he been caught having contact with an \nUndesirable?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, his throat dry. \u201cNo, nothing like that.\u201d \n\n \u201cAh, well. It\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d said Thicknesse. \u201cIf you ask me, the blood \ntraitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood day, Minister.\u201d \n\n Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The \nmoment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out \nfrom under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in \nthe opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure \nhis big feet were hidden. \n\n Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after \ngleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner\u2019s name and \noccupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed \nto force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and \nHermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all \ntheir efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment\u2019s \nthought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck \nin court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do \nmagic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman\u2019s liberty possibly depending on the \noutcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly \nwell that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. \n\n He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The \nsilence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the \npurple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast \nover the place. \n\n Her office must be up here, Harry thought. \n\n It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but \non the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off \nalong the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring \ninstructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. \n\n Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway \nalong the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and \nwizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly \npolished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite \nmesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of \ncolored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, \nHarry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the \nsame pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the \ncreation of pamphlets \u2013 that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, \nfolded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. \n\n Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing \nthat he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed \n\n\f\npamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility \nCloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: \n\n \n\nMudbloods \n\nand the Dangers They Pose to \n\na Peaceful Pure-Blood Society \n\n \n\n Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of \nits petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author\u2019s \nname upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to \ntingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she \nsaid, still waving and twirling her wand, \u201cWill the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all \nday, does anyone know?\u201d \n\n \u201cCareful,\u201d said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages \nslipped and fell to the floor. \n\n \u201cWhat, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?\u201d \n\n The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of \npamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there \nmight have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue \niris had been set into the wood \u2013 an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had \nknown Alastor Moody. \n\n For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He \neven forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. \nIt was not moving. It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read: \n\n \n\nDolores Umbridge \n\nSenior Undersecretary to the Minister \n\n \n\n Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read: \n\n \n\nHead of the Muggle-Born \n\nRegistration Commission \n\n \n\n Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon \ntheir work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty \noffice opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object \nwith little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the \nCloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. \n\n It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of \nhim. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, \nthere came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The \nyoung witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her \nfellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the \ndoorknob, stepped into Umbridge\u2019s office, and closed the door behind him. \n\n\f\n He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge\u2019s office \nat Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls \nbore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, \ngamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a fl", "input_ids": [1, 29892, 7149, 30098, 1584, 1244, 29892, 297, 278, 5192, 310, 278, 29871, 13, 8140, 6020, 8530, 2296, 28996, 964, 278, 13777, 18034, 10515, 1421, 29892,

look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.\n\u3000\u3000The reporter had reappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! \\What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors.\n\u3000\u3000\"When will they learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, \"that hanging's the only way to deal with these people?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's runner beans.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \"I'd better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aunt Marge?\" he blurted out. \"Sh -- she's not coming here, is she?\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), he had been forced to call her \"Aunt\" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry's mind.\n\u3000\u3000At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Marge'll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're on the subject\" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- \"we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of entertainment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you'll keep a civil tongue in your head when you're talking to Marge.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if she does when she's talking to me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply, \"as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any -- any funny stuff while she's here.\n\u3000\u3000You behave yourself, got me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I will if she does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, \"we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \"I'll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. \"Mummy's bought him a lovely new bow tie.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. \"See you in a bit, then,\" he said, and he left the kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not taking you,\" he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush.\n\u3000\u3000\"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \"it'll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large, purple face. \"It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?\" roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,\" he said grimly.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a Mug -- like I'm normal and everything.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form.\"\n\u3000\u3000He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hed", "input_ids": [1, 7419, 472, 670, 11315, 3850, 13, 30358, 30358, 3868, 10322, 263, 11777, 29891, 1106, 2625, 1994, 472, 10686, 29892,

We've got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.\n\u3000\u3000Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get your filthy hands off it,\" Harry snarled under his breath. \"Shh!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"We're all down there... and now we've just got to wait until we come back up again....\"\n\u3000\u3000She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out... there were so many of them....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.\n\u3000\u3000\"But what was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,\" said Harry. \"A real Patronus. A powerful one.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But who conjured it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but how could it have been?\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't you see what they looked like?\" said Hermione eagerly. \"Was it one of the teachers?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"He wasn't a teacher.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I saw him,\" said Harry slowly. \"But... maybe I imagined it.... I wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who did you think it was?\"\n\u3000\u3000I think --\" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. I think it was my dad.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead,\" she said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think you saw his ghost?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know... no... he looked solid....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But then --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe I was seeing things,\" said Harry. \"But... from what I could see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.\n\u3000\u3000I know it sounds crazy,\" said Harry flatly. He turned to took at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....\n\u3000\u3000The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting.\n\u3000\u3000And then, at last, after over an hour...\n\u3000\u3000\"Here we come!\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, \"we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\" snapped Hermione. \"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right!\"\n\u3000\u3000The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --\n\u3000\u3000\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He's transforming\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Harry suddenly. \"We've got to move!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We mustn't, I keep telling you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick!\" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming any moment --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Back to Hagrid's!\" Harry said. \"It's empty now -- come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....\n\u3000\u3000The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh, Fang, it's us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to try and interfere,\" said Harry quickly. \"But if we don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to rescue Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment....\n\u3000\u3000For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid'", "input_ids": [1, 505, 9559, 29973, 1334, 29915,

though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us some-' thing important!\"\n\u3000\u3000Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\n\u3000\u3000\"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just asked her if she'd seen anything odd, and she started to say\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - that - that's nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Percy at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spot\n\u3000\u3000ted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I did think she'd keep her word. It's nothing, really, Id just rather -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, we won't laugh.\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy didn't smile back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I'm starving.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn't about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors. His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was Hagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\"\n\u3000\u3000(ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night ......\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don't you leave us here, sir, we've only got one more corridor to go -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go and prepare my next class -\"\n\u3000\u3000And he hurried off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair, more like.\"\n\u3000\u3000They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines.\n\u3000\u3000\"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and see -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron's foot, \"and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry -\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,\n\u3000\u3000Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you've ever come up with.\"\n\u3000\u3000They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they had to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione's rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one'll ever know . .....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\n\u3000\u3000Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey's view.\n\u3000\u3000It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free.\n\u3000\u3000It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\n\u3000\u3000Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born\n\u3000\u3000from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.\n\u3000\u3000And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes.\n\u3000\u3000It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's because I understand Parseltongue . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the beds around him.\n\u3000\u3000\"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died - because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk.

Muggle-borns to evade the \nMinistry.\" \n\"The what?\" \n\"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who's name!\" \n\"Oh, yeah, Well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into,\" said Harry. \"But \nI haven't got a problem calling him V ---\" \n\"NO!\" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose \nburied in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. \"Sorry,\" said \nRon, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, \"but the name's been jinxed, \nHarry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks protective \nenchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance --- it's how they \nfound us in Tottenham Court Road!\" \n\"Because we used his *name*?\" \n\"Exactly! You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people \nwho were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared \nuse it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable --- \nquick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley ---\" \n\"You're kidding?\" \n\"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said but he fought his way \nout. He's on the run now just like us.\" Ron scratched his chin \nthoughtfully with \nthe end of his wand. \"You don't reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?\" \n\"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?\" \n\"Oh yeah...\" \nThey moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. \n\"Harry... you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?\" \n\"Dumbledore what?\" \nRon looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, \"Dumbledore ... the \ndoe? I mean,\" Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \"he had \nthe real sword last, didn't he? \n\n\n\f\nHarry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing \nbehind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to \nthem, that he was watching over them, would have inexpressibly comforting. \nHe shook his head. \n\"Dumbledore\u2019s dead,\" he said. \"I saw it happen, I saw the body. He's \ndefinitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe\" \n\"Patronuses can change, though can't they?\" said Ron, \"Tonks\u2019s changed \ndidn't it?\" \nYeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why \nwouldn't he just hand us the sword? \n\"Search me,\" said Ron. \"Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was \nalive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's \nstories?\" \n\"Which is what?\" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate \nfor the answer. \n\"I dunno,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hacked \noff, he was having a laugh or --- or he just wanted to make it more \ndifficult, But I don't think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when \nhe gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -- well,\" Ron's ears turned bright \nred and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded \nwith his toe, \"he must've known I'd run out on you.\" \n\"No,\" Harry corrected him. \"He must've known you'd always want to come \nback.\" \nRon looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry \nsaid, \"Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?\" \n\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron at once, \"people are talking about it quite a lot. \n'Course, if things were different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals \nwith Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who \ndidn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who \nthought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, \nthough. He was really young when they --\" \n\"Our age,\" said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in \nhis face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject. \nA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry \ntook aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which \n\n\f\nHermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of \nblackthorn. \n\"*Engorgio*\" \n\"The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried \nagain. This time the spider grew slightly larger. \n\"Stop that,\" said Ron sharply, \" I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, \nokay?\" \nHarry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. \n\"Sorry --- *Reducio*\" \nThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every \nminor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful \nthan those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt \nintrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of \nhis arm. \n\"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them \nnoiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to \nenlarge and reduce the spider. \"It\u2019s all a matter of confidence Harry.\" \nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about \nbreaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she \ncould take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he \nwould have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he \nagreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and \nvanished behind her book once more. \nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took \nfirst watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand \nlevitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and \nless powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk \nreading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small \nwooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it. \n\"There's this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the \nnews like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are \nfollowing the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's \ngreat. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing \nlocations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... \nTrouble is, I missed the last one...\" \n\n\n\f\nHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random \nwords under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly \nfearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might \nnot have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione \nturned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the \nblackthorn wand. \nFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. \n\"If it's annoying you, I'll stop!\" he told Hermione nervously. \nHermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. \n\"We need to talk,\"", "input_ids": [1,

It was quite as ugly as the old one.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \"He's really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\"\n\u3000\u3000In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled\n\u3000\u3000himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.\n\u3000\u3000Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - \"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, I -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never ='\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.\"\n\u3000\u3000And he stomped out looking embarrassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Harry, I don't,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \"But I still want to talk to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.\n\u3000\u3000*208*\n\u3000\u3000\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\" he said gently. \"Anything at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin ....\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn't anything, Professor . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.\n\u3000\u3000\"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\n\u3000\u3000*209*\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ......\n\u3000\u3000Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry's in a hurry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\" said George, chortling.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny didn't find it amusing either.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, don't,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,\" said Ron knowingly. \"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're getting all the credit for his dirty work.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\"\n\u3000\u3000At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could\n\u3000\u3000*210*\n\u3000\u3000play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.\n\u3000\u3000Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.\n\u3000\u3000\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his present. \"I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It's ready.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. \"If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you speaking to me again?\"\n\u3000\u3000211\n\u3000\u3000She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.\n\u3000\u3000The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a", "input_ids": [1, 278, 408, 13244, 29889, 739, 471, 3755, 408, 22769, 408, 278, 2030, 697, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 29908, 3112, 29915, 29879, 263, 28503, 366,

How's that going to help Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at her shadowy face.\n\u3000\u3000\"There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,\" he said slowly. \"What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid's three hours ago....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,\" said Hermione. \"We just heard ourselves leaving....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent life....\" And then it hit him. \"Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -- how will that help Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak -- they can escape together!\"\n\u3000\u3000From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?\" said Harry. He stood up and pressed his ear against the door. \"Doesn't sound like anyone's there.... Come on, let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.\n\u3000\u3000\"If anyone's looking out of the window --\" Hermione squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll run for it,\" said Harry determinedly. \"Straight into the forest, all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the forest....\n\u3000\u3000Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" she gasped. \"We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of sight, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh shouldn've come!\" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done,\" Harry said fervently.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's move along a bit,\" Hermione whispered. \"We need to get nearer to Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now?\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione. \"If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's tied outside!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's going to give us about sixty seconds,\" said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's cabin.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\" Hermione whispered. \"I'm going to find Scabbers in a moment --\"\n\u3000\u3000Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Harry suddenly, \"what if we -- we just run in there and grab Pettigrew --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Don't you understand? We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid's house?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,\" said Harry, \"or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay!\" said Harry. \"It was just an idea, I just thought\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're about to come out!\" Hermione breathed.\n\u3000\u3000And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay...\" Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on. Get goin'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll tell them what really happened\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't kill him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go quick. Don' listen....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is the beast?\" came the cold voice of Macnair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Out -- outside,\" Hagrid croaked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --\"\n\u3000\u3000Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait here,\" Harry whispered to Hermione. \"I'll do it.\"\n\u3000\u3000As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,",

destructive that the Horcrux can\u2019t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one \nantidote, and it\u2019s incredibly rare \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201c\u2013 phoenix tears,\u201d said Harry, nodding. \n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cOur problem is that there are very few substances as \ndestructive as basilisk venom, and they\u2019re all dangerous to carry around with you. That\u2019s \na problem we\u2019re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a \nHorcrux won\u2019t do the trick. You\u2019ve got to put it beyond magical repair.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwhy can\u2019t the bit of soul in \nit just go and live in something else?\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\u201d \n\nSeeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. \n\u201cLook, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn\u2019t \ndamage your soul at all.\u201d \n\n\u201dWhich would be a real comfort to me, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Ron. Harry laughed. \n\n\u201cIt should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your \nsoul will survive, untouched,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut it\u2019s the other way round with a \n\n\f\nHorcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for \nsurvival. It can\u2019t exist without it.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat diary sort of died when I stabbed it,\u201d said Harry, remembering ink pouring \nlike blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul as \nit vanished. \n\n\u201cAnd once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no \nlonger exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but \nobviously it came back good as new.\u201d \n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Ron, frowning. \u201cThe bit of soul in that diary was possessing \nGinny, wasn\u2019t it? How does that work, then?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhile the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and \nout of someone if they get too close to the object. I don\u2019t mean holding it for too long, it\u2019s \nnothing to do with touching it,\u201d she added before Ron could speak. \u201cI mean close \nemotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly \nvulnerable. You\u2019re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.\u201d \n\n\u201cI wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ask \nhim? I never really . . .\u201d \n\nHis voice trailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked \nDumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had \nwasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to \nfind out everything. . . . \n\nThe silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking \ncrash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked \nunder the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded \nChocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry \ninstinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, \nwhose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room \nthat need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books \nflying in every direction. \u201cwe will . . . we\u2019re sorry . . .\u201d \n\nWith an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after \nMrs. Weasley. \n\n\u201cit\u2019s like being a house-elf,\u201d complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his \nhead as he and Harry followed. \u201cExcept without the job satisfaction. The sooner this \nwedding\u2019s over, the happier, I\u2019ll be.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . \nIt\u2019ll be like a holiday, won\u2019t it?\u201d \n\nRon started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents \nwaiting for them in Mrs. Weasley\u2019s room, stopped quite abruptly. \n\nThe Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o\u2019 clock. Harry, Ron, \nHermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur\u2019s family by this time; and \nit was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry \nattempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped \nout into the sunny backyard to await the visitors. \n\n\f\nHarry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old \nWellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by \ntwo new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was \nno breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had \nbeen shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, \nplucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, \nthought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes. \n\nHe had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the \nBurrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer \npossible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had \ntherefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by \nPortkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which \nturned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, \nladen with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf green robes, who \ncould be Fleur\u2019s mother. \n\n\u201cMaman!\u201d cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. \u201cPapa!\u201d \n\nMonsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head \nshorter and extremely plumb, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked \ngood-natured. Bouncing towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice \non each cheek, leaving her flustered. \n\n\u201cYou \u2018ave been so much trouble,\u201d he said in a deep voice. \u201cFleur tells us you \u2018ave \nbeen working very \u2018ard.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s been nothing, nothing!\u201d trilled Mrs. Weasley. \u201cNo trouble at all!\u201d \n\nRon relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from \nbehind one of the new Flutterby bushes. \n\n\u201cDear lady!\u201d said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley\u2019s hand between \nhis own two plump ones and beaming. \u201cWe are most honored at the approaching union of \nour two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.\u201d \n\nMadame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. \n\n\u201cEnchant\u00e9e,\u201d she said. \u201cYour \u2018usband \u2018as been telling us such amusing stories!\u201d \n\nMr.", "input_ids": [1, 13, 30015, 3112, 1838, 30010, 29873, 505, 304, 367, 263, 2362, 309, 3873, 285, 574, 3995, 1497, 10515, 1421, 16500, 368, 29889, 1346, 3112,

slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon \nhis pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. \nRon gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms. \n\n \n\nHermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could \nreach. \n\n \n\n\"Ouch -- ow -- gerroff! What the --? Hermione -- OW!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n\"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!\" \n\n \n\nShe punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as \nHermione advanced. \n\n \n\n\"You -- crawl -- back -- here -- after -- weeks -- and -- weeks -- oh, where's my wand?\" \n\n \n\nShe looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively. \n\n \n\n\"Protego!\" \n\n \n\nThe invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her \nbackward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. \n\n \n\"Hermione!\" said Harry. \"Calm --\" \n\n \n\n\"I will not calm down!\" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; \nshe looked quite demented. \"Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!\" \n\n \n\n\"Hermione, will you please --\" \n\n \n\n\"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!\" she screeched. \"Don't you dare! Give it back \nnow! And YOU!\" \n\n \n\nShe was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not \nblame Ron for retreating several steps. \n\n \n\n\"I cam running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back\" \n\"I know,\" Ron said, \"Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really --\" \n\n \n\n\"Oh, you're sorry!\" \n\n \n\nShe laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but \nHarry merely grimaced his helplessness. \n\n \n\n\"You came back after weeks -- weeks -- and you think it's all going to be all right if you \njust say sorry?\" \n\n \n\n\"Well, what else can I say?\" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back. \n\n \n\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. \"Rack your brains, Ron, that \nshould only take a couple of seconds --\" \n\n \n\n\"Hermione,\" interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, \"he just saved my --\" \n\n \n\n\f\n\"I don't care!\" she screamed. \"I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could \nhave been dead for all he knew --\" \n\n \n\n\"I knew you weren't dead!\" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and \napproaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. \"Harry's all over \nthe Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and \nmental stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's \nbeen like --\" \n\n \n\n\"What it's been like for you?? \n\n \n\nHer voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a \nlevel of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his \nopportunity. \n\n \n\n\"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of \nSnatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!\" \n\"A gang of what?\" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her \narms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for \nseveral years. \n\n \n\n\"Snatchers,\" said Ron. \"They're everywhere -- gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up \nMuggle-borns and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone \ncaptured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, \nthought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to \nthe Ministry.\" \n\n \n\n\"What did you say to them?\" \n\"Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.\" \n\"And they believed that?\" \n\"They weren't the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the smell of him....\" \n\n \n\nRon glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of \nhumor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. \n\n \n\n\"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be \nhonest, but there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. \nThen two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit \nthe one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, \nand Disapparated. I didn't do it so well. Splinched myself again\" -- Ron held up his right \nhand to show two missing fingernails: Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly -- \"and I \n\n\f\ncame out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank \nwhere we'd been ... you were gone.\" \n\n \n\n\"Gosh, what a gripping story,\" Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when \nwishing to wound. \"You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's \nHollow and, let's think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake \nturned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and \nmissed us by about a second.\" \n\"What?\" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him. \n\n \n\"Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, \ndoesn't it?\" \n\"Hermione,\" said Harry quietly, \"Ron just saved my life.\" \n\n \n\nShe appeared not to have heard him. \n\n \n\"One thing I would like to know, though,\" she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over \nRon's head. \"How exactly did you find us tonight? That's important. Once we know, we'll \nbe able to make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see.\" \n\n \n\nRon glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. \n\n \n\"This.\" \n\n \n\nShe had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them. \n\n \n\n\"The Deluminator?\" she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. \n\n \n\n\"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off,\" said Ron. \"I don't know how it works or why it \nhappened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since \nI left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ...

place.\n\u3000\u3000His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny?\n\u3000\u3000He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.\n\u3000\u3000Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\n\u3000\u3000*306*\n\u3000\u3000Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified. But then she must be\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\n\u3000\u3000\"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.\n\u3000\u3000A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him\n\u3000\u3000\"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, she won't wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She's not - she's not -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.\n\u3000\u3000* 30 7*\n\u3000\u3000\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\n\u3000\u3000He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk ... I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment .... Please, help me -1)\n\u3000\u3000Riddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\n\u3000\u3000But his wand had gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see -?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\n\u3000\u3000A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it -\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's smile broadened.\n\u3000\u3000\"You won't be needing it,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000*%08*\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, I won't be -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here ....\n\u3000\u3000\"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \"how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000All the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven- year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to\n\u3000\u3000*309*\n\u3000\u3000confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .\n\u3000\u3000Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\n\u3000\u3000\" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became .... Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself.

sort of general direction, but. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice trailed away hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\n\u3000\u3000* 21:L *\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.\n\u3000\u3000Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\n\u3000\u3000* 2-V2 *\n\u3000\u3000Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've come this far,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\n\u3000\u3000They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.\n\u3000\u3000Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ... sounds like something big ......\n\u3000\u3000They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It's already heard Fang!\"\n\u3000\u3000The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\n\u3000\u3000* 273*\n\u3000\u3000stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno -\"\n\u3000\u3000Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it's our car!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \"Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.\n\u3000\u3000*214*\n\u3000\u3000\"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've lost the trail,\" he said. \"C'mon, let's go and find them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.\n\u3000\u3000Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.\n\u3000\u3000He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of\n\u3000\u3000*21$*\n\u3000\u3000a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\n\u3000\u3000Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in", "input_ids": [1, 306, 1073,

\nwhile the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making \ndecisions, Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; \nnow Bill was really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the \ntiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if \nfrom the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left \nbehind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry\u2019s grief for Dobby \nseemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a \nvast, silent ocean. \n\n\f\n \u201cI want to do it properly,\u201d were the first words of which Harry was fully \nconscious of speaking. \u201cNot by magic. Have you got a spade?\u201d And shortly afterward he \nhad set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end \nof the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, \nglorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a \ngift to the elf who had saved their lives. \n\n His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. \nHe had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing \nDumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able \nto possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could \nnot penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort \nout\u2026though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. \n\n On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in \nsweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his \nown breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the \nMalfoys\u2019 returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding \nblossomed in the darkness\u2026 \n\n The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. \nHallows\u2026Horcruxes\u2026Hallows\u2026Horcruxes\u2026yet no longer burned with that weird, \nobsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been \nslapped awake again. \n\n Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had \nbeen tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why\u2026 \n\n And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of \nmercy\u2026Dumbledore had foreseen that\u2026How much more had he known? \n\n Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few \ndegrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. \u201cHow\u2019s Hermione?\u201d \u201cBetter,\u201d said \nRon. \u201cFleur\u2019s looking after her.\u201d Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him \nwhy he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. \nThey jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they \nworked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. \n\n Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the \ngrave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf\u2019s bare feet. Dean \nproduced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby\u2019s head, muffling his \nbatlike ears. \u201cWe should close his eyes.\u201d \n\n Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a \ntraveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of \nwhat Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing \ngown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. \nLuna, who was huddled in one of Fleur\u2019s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers \ntenderly upon each of the elf\u2019s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. \u201cThere,\u201d she \nsaid softly. \u201cNow he could be sleeping.\u201d \n\n Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have \nbeen resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced \nhimself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, and the rows and \nrows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of \n\n\f\nDumbledore\u2019s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that \nDobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a \nroughly dug hole. \u201cI think we ought to say something,\u201d piped up Luna. \u201cI\u2019ll go first, \nshall I?\u201d \n\n And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the \ngrave. \u201cThank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It\u2019s so unfair that \nyou had to die when you were so good and brave. I\u2019ll always remember what you did for \nus. I hope you\u2019re happy now.\u201d \n\n She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a \nthick voice, \u201cyeah\u2026thanks Dobby.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. \n\u201cGood bye Dobby,\u201d he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. \nBill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell \nneatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. \u201cD\u2019ya mind if I stay here a moment?\u201d He asked \nthe others. \n\n They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and \nthen they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. \n\n He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the \nsea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, \npillowlike, over the place where Dobby\u2019s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for \na wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now \nremember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of \nsomeone\u2019s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and \npointed it at the rock. \n\n Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock\u2019s \nsurface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more \nquickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry \nstood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. \n\n He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar \nstill prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, \nideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. \n\n They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their \nattention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a \nsmall fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud \nupon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. \n\n \u201c\u2026lucky that Ginny\u2019s on holiday. If she\u2019d been at Hogwarts they could have \ntaken her before we reached her. Now we know she\u2019s safe too.\u201d He looked around and \nsaw Harry standing there. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting them all", "input_ids": [1, 297, 372, 763, 263, 9654, 300, 29889, 29871, 13, 13,

unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do watch where you're going, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry, Professor --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well, here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend somewhere, Potter....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can have it back?\" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \"I daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night....\"\n\u3000\u3000Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... anything,\" said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. \"You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She was only trying to help....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. \"She's in the common room how working, for a change --\"\n\u3000\u3000They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wrote them down!\" Neville was saying tearfully. \"But I must've dropped them somewhere!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A likely tale!\" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: \"Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've lost the passwords!\" Neville told them miserably. \"I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where'd you get it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Will you let me have a go?\" \"Have you ridden it yet, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I just hold it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she looked up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I got it back,\" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- there might have been!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, at least you know now that it's safe!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"Id better put it upstairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll take it!\" said Ron eagerly. \"I've got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys' staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I sit down, then?\" Harry asked Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\"Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity\" and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over.\n\u3000\u3000\"How are you getting through all this stuff?\" Harry asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,\" said Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?\" Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.\n\u3000\u3000\"I couldn't do that!\" said Hermione, looking scandalized.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arithmancy looks terrible,\" said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no, it's wonderful!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"It's my favorite subject! It's --\"\n\u3000\u3000But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys' staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.\n\u3000\u3000\"LOOK!\" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table.\n\u3000\u3000\"LOOK!\" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, what --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like --\n\u3000\u3000\"BLOOD!\" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \"HE'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"N -- no,\" said Hermione in a trembling voice.\n\u3000\u3000Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\u3000\u3000GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\n\u3000\u3000It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical Menagerie.\n\u3000\u3000Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\" she said shrilly. \"First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\" said Fred bracingly. \"And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he probably didn't feel a thing.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fred!\" said Ginny indignantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"All he did was eat and",

Harry you\u2019re trying to \nfit everything into the Hallows story ---\u201c \n\n\u201cFit everything in?\u201d he repeated. \u201cHermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the \nsign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the \nPeverells!\u201d \n\n\u201cA minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you reckon the ring is now?\u201d Ron asked Harry. \u201cWhat did Dumbledore \ndo with it after he broke it open?\u201d \n\n\u201cBut Harry\u2019s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione\u2019s\u2026 \n\nThree objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of \nDeath\u2026Master\u2026Conqueror\u2026Vanquisher\u2026The last enemy that shall be destroyed is \ndeath\u2026 \n\nAnd he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose \nHorcruxes were no match\u2026Neither can live while the other survives\u2026Was this the \nanswer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the \none who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d \n\nBut he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was \nrunning it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen \nanything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was \nexactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer \ncompletely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable \nconcealment, no matter what spells are cast at it\u2026 \n\nAnd then, with a gasp, he remembered\u2014 \n\n\u201cDumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\u201d \n\nHis voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. \n\n\u201cMy mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He \nwanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is \nburied in Godric\u2019s Hollow\u2026\u201d Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as \n\n\f\nthough great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \u201cHe\u2019s my ancestor. I\u2019m \ndescended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\u201d \n\n\u201cHe felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of \npossessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the \nother two. \n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his \nneck, his fingers shaking hard. \n\n\u201cRead it,\u201d he told her, pushing his mother\u2019s letter into her hand. \u201cRead it! \nDumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn\u2019t need a \nCloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself \ncompletely invisible without one!\u201d \n\nSomething fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged \nthe Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly \ntapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder \nerupted inside him so that he shouted out. \n\n\u201cIT\u2019S IN HERE! He left me the ring \u2013 it\u2019s in the Snitch!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou --- you reckon?\u201d \n\nHe could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear \nto Harry. Everything fit, everything\u2026His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he \ndiscovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to \ndo was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then --- \n\nBut it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope \nand happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the \nglorious spell was broken. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s after.\u201d \n\nThe change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. \n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s after the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\nHe turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. \nIt all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a \nvery old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and \nHermione as he looked out into the night, thinking\u2026 \n\nVoldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him \nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. \nHardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew \nabout them? \n\nHarry gazed into the darkness\u2026If Voldemort had known about the Deathly \nHallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects \nthat made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he \nmight not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn\u2019t the simple fact that he had \ntaken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last \ngreat Wizarding secret? \n\nWhich meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full \npower, without understanding that it was one of three\u2026for the wand was the Hallow that \ncould not be hidden, whose existence was best known\u2026The bloody trail of the Elder \nWand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history\u2026 \n\n\f\nHarry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the \nface of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. \n\nHe turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing \nexactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily\u2019s letter, Ron at her side \nlooking slightly anxious. Didn\u2019t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few \nminutes? \n\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own \nastonished certainty, \u201cThis explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I\u2019ve \ngot one --- maybe two ---\u201c \n\nHe held up the Snitch. \n\n\u201c--- and You-Know-Who\u2019s chasing the third, but he doesn\u2019t realize\u2026he just \nthinks it\u2019s a powerful wand ---\u201c \n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily\u2019s letter, \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think you\u2019ve got this wrong, all wrong.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? It all fits ---\u201c \n\n\u201cNot, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. Harry, you\u2019re just getting carried away. \nPlease,\u201d she said as she started to speak, \u201cplease just answer me this: If the Deathly \nHallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who \npossessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldn\u2019t he have told \nyou? Why?\u201d \n\nHe had his answer ready. \n\n\u201cBut you said it, Hermione! You\u2019ve got to find out about them for yourself! It\u2019s a \nQuest!\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods\u2019!\u201d cried \nHermione in exasperation. \u201cI didn\u2019t really believe it!\u201d \n\nHarry took no notice. \n\n\u201cDumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, \ntake risks. This feels like the kind of thing he\u2019d do.\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry, this isn\u2019t a game, this isn\u2019t practice! This is the real thing, and \nDumbledore", "input_ids": [1, 694, 1316, 2655, 408, 263, 2538, 20503, 428, 29871, 13, 855, 650, 8530, 29871, 13, 13, 29950, 837, 1421, 454, 2156, 304, 902, 6900, 29892,

afternoon sky. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be Luna\u2019s house, \nwho else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like a bird,\u201d said Hermione, frowning at the tower. \n\n \u201cI was talking about a chess rook,\u201d said Ron. \u201cA castle to you.\u201d \n\n Ron\u2019s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry \nand Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they \nfound him grinning broadly. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s theirs,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLook.\u201d \n\n Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. The first read, \n\n THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X. LOVEGOOD \n\n \n\nthe second, \n\n PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE \n\n \n\nthe third, \n\n KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS \n\n \n\n\f\n The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door \nwas overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange \nradishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a \nSnargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent \nwith the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy \ncrowns of white beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little \nowl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the \nbranches. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s you Mr. \nLovegood wants to help, not us.\u201d \n\n He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She \nthen rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and \nbore a knocker shaped like an eagle. \n\nBarely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood \nXenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained \nnightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius \nhad been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by comparison. \n\"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?\" he cried in a \nhigh-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and \nfinally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O. \n\"Hello, Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry, holding out his hand, \"I'm Harry, \nHarry Potter.\" \nXenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not \npointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. \n\"Would it be okay if we came in?\" asked Harry. \"There's something we'd \nlike to ask you.\" \n\"I . . . I'm not sure that's advisable,\" whispered Xenophilius, He \nswallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. \"Rather a shock . . . My \nword . . . I . . . I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to ---\" \n\"It wont take long\" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this \nless-than-warm welcome. \n\"I --- oh, all right then. Come in, quickly, Quickly!\" \nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door \nshut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had \never seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being \ninside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls - the \nstove, the sink, and the cupboards - and all of it had been painted with \nflowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he \nrecognized Luna's styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was \nslightly overwhelming. \nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase ld to the \nupper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from \noverhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. \n\"You'd better come up.\" said Xenophilius, still looking extremely \nuncomfortable, and he led the way. \nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, \n\n\f\nand as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller \nand entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on \nthe unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic \nlabyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon \npiles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of \ncreatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung \nfrom the ceiling. \nLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden \nobject covered in magically turning cogs and wheels, It looked like the \nbizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves, but after a moment \nHarry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact \nthat it was churning out Quibblers. \n\"Excuse me,\" said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized \ngrubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, \nwhich all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat \nmuffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry. \n\"Why have you come here?\" \nBefore Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock. \n\"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?\" \nSee was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a \nunicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into \nthe room. \n\"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\" said Xenophilius. \n\"No it isn't!\" said Hermione. \n\"Hermione,\" muttered Harry, embarrassed, \"now's not the moment -\" \n\"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and \nit's an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!\" \n\"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?\" asked Ron, edging away from the \nhorn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room. \n\"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. \nLovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can \nexplode at the slightest touch?\" \n\"The Crumple Horned Snorkack\" said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish \nlook upon his face, \u201cis a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -\" \n\"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's \nan Erumpent horn and it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got \nit-\" \n\"I bought it,\" said Xenophilius dogmatically. \"Two weeks ago, from a \ndelightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A \nChristmas surprise for my Luna. Now,\" he said, turning to Harry, \"why \nexactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?\" \n\"We need some help,\" said Harry, before Hermione could start again. \n\"Ah,\" said Xenophilius, \"Help, Hmm.\" \nHis good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously \nterrified and mesmerized. \n\"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...\" \n\n\f\n \"", "input_ids": [1, 29892, 988, 263, 1556, 29871, 13, 303, 3881, 29899, 23261, 3699, 11492, 4837, 1711, 2750, 278, 14744,

\u2013\u201c said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off \nand walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to \nLupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled \nhim. Now Lupin\u2019s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a \n\n\f\nsickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that \nthey were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. \n\nHe turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. \n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have called him a coward.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron at once. \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s acting like one.\u201d \n\n\u201cAll the same . . .\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut if it makes him go back to Tonks, it\u2019ll be worth it, \nwon\u2019t it?\u201d \n\nHe could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron \nuncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have \nbacked Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son \nhad treated his old friend? \n\nThe silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron \nand Hermione\u2019s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still \nlying on the table, Harry\u2019s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He \nwalked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He \ncould not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He \nwas sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other \nside of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore\u2019s name leapt out at him. It \nwas a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a \nfamily group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to \nright: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth. \n\nHis attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore\u2019s \nfather, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this \nfaded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no \nmore distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. \nHer face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he\u2019d \nseen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed \nabove a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets \nand had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but \notherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus\u2019s nose had been \nbroken and before he started wearing glasses. \n\nThe family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the \nnewspaper. Baby Ariana\u2019s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the \npicture and saw the headline: \n\n \n\n EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING \n\n BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n\n by Rita Skeeter \n\n \n\nThinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry \nbegan to read: \n\n \n\n\f\nProud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-\nWold after her husband Percival\u2019s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in \nAzkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric\u2019s Hollow, \nthe village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter\u2019s strange escape \nfrom You-Know-Who. \n\n Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric\u2019s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding \nfamilies, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about \nher husband\u2019s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the \nfriendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family \nwas left well alone. \n\n \u201cSlammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch \nof homemade Cauldron Cakes,\u201d says Bathilda Bagshot. \u201cThe first year they were \nthere I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn\u2019t have known there was a daughter if I \nhadn\u2019t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and \nsaw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, \nkeeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn\u2019t know what to make of \nit.\u201d \n\n It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric\u2019s Hollow was the perfect \nopportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been \nplanning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old \nwhen she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that \nmagic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever \ndemonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that \nKendra made a decision to hide her daughter\u2019s existence rather than suffer the shame \nof admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and \nneighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. \nThe tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana\u2019s existence could be \ncounted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected \nawkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. \u201cMy sister is too \nfrail for school.\u201d \n\n Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts \u2013 the Prizes and the Pretense. \n\n \n\n Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He \nlooked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he \nfind out? He wanted to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk \nto him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. \nHe was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s opinions, \nwhen a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. \n\n For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His \nimmediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he \ndid not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside \nhis chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to \nHarry, croaked, \u201cKreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\u201d \n\n Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too \nquick for him. \n\n \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d \n\n\f\n Mundungus\u2019s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, \nMundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone \nfloor with a muffled crunch. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron\u2019s grip. \n\u201cWha\u2019ve I done? Setting a bleedin\u2019 \u2018house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha\u2019ve I \ndone, lemme go, lemme go, of \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re not in much of a position to make threats,\u201d said Harry", "input_ids": [1, 13, 30015, 2177, 1237, 3995, 1497, 10686, 29892, 1346, 9344, 29876, 30010, 29873, 5967, 1009, 413, 4841, 6521, 785, 6521, 896, 30010, 345, 2355, 304, 3178,

look.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll do it,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \"Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good man, Harry!\" roared Hagrid. \"Right then -- let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\"\n\u3000\u3000He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Easy) now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. \"Tha's it,\" said Hagrid. \"Tha's it, Harry... now, bow.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.\n\u3000\u3000The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right -- back away, now, Harry, easy does it\n\u3000\u3000But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done, Harry!\" said Hagrid, ecstatic. \"Right -- yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it.\n\u3000\u3000The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righ' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!\"\n\u3000\u3000This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,\" said Hagrid, \"an' mind yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, then'\" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.\n\u3000\u3000Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry, he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\"\n\u3000\u3000Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him. \"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not dangerous at all, are you?\" he said to the hippogriff. \"Are you, you great ugly brute?\"\n\u3000\u3000It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm dying!\" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \"I'm dying, look at me! It's killed me!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yer not dyin'!\" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \"Someone help me -- gotta get him outta here --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"They should fire him straight away!\" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was Malfoy's fault!\" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.\n\u3000\u3000They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to see if he's okay!\" said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think he'll be all right?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,\" said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though, wasn't it?\" said Ron, looking worried. \"Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him....\"\n\u3000\u3000They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000\"They wouldn't fire him, would they?\" said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'd better not,\" said Ron, who wasn't eating either.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back,\" said Ron gloomily.\n\u3000\u3000They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's a light on in H", "input_ids": [1, 896, 3282, 29915, 29873, 2833, 304, 763, 1641, 260, 1979, 287, 763, 445, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 29908, 3782, 697, 3026, 1497, 379,

It lifted an inch into the \nair and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he \npulled himself up into the room. \nHe did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the \ndying man: he did not know what he felt as he saw Snape's white \nface, adn the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his \nneck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon \nthe man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he cried \nto speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his \nrobes and pulled him close. \nA terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. \n\"Take...it...Take...it...\" \nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, \nneither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and \nhis eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do-- \nA flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand \nby Hermione. Harry lfited the silvery substance into it with his \nwand. When the falsk was full to the brim, and Snape looked as \nthough there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes \nslackened. \n\"Look...at....me...\" he whispered. \nThe green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in \n\n\f\nthe depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, \nblank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and \nSnape moved no more. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Three \n\nThe Prince\u2019s Tale \n\n \n\nHarry remained kneeling at Snape\u2019s side, simply staring down at him, until quite \nsuddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the \nflask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. \n\n Voldemort\u2019s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that \nhe was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of \nHogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he \nstood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. \n\n \u201cYou have fought,\u201d said the high, cold voice, \u201cvaliantly. Lord Voldemort knows \nhow to value bravery. \n\n \u201cYet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all \ndie, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a \nloss and a waste. \n\n \u201cLord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. \n\n \u201cYou have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. \n\n \u201cI speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to \ndie for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. \nIf, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then \nbattle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find \nyou, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you \nfrom me. One hour.\u201d \n\n Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Hermione wildly. \u201cLet\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s get back to the castle, if \nhe\u2019s gone to the forest we\u2019ll need to think of a new plan \u2013 \u201d \n\n She glanced at Snape\u2019s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron \nfollowed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He \ndid not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason \nfor which it had been done\u2026 \n\n They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered \nwhether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. \n\n You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I \nshall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest\u2026One hour\u2026 \n\n Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only \nbe an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the \nstone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There \nwas no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. \n\n\f\n The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or \nscreams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. \nEmeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered \nwood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. \n\n \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d whispered Hermione. \n\n Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. \n\n The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in \ngroups, their arms around each other\u2019s necks. The injured were being treated upon the \nraised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the \ninjured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. \n\n The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred\u2019s body, \nbecause his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was \nlying across Fred\u2019s chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears \ncascaded down his cheeks. \n\n Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione \napproach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, \nand Percy, who flung an arm around Ron\u2019s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved \ncloser to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. \nRemus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, \nenchanted ceiling. \n\n The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled \nbackward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any \nof the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the \nWeasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first \nplace, Fred might never have died\u2026 \n\n He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks\u2026 He yearned not \nto feel\u2026 He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming \ninside him\u2026 \n\n The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass \nmourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of \nSnape\u2019s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle \nguarding the headmaster\u2019s office. \n\n \u201cPassword?\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore!\u201d said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned \nto see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. \n\n But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that \nhung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained \nto see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the \ncastle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. \n\n Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore\u2019s deserted", "input_ids": [1, 21435, 373, 278, 11904, 29889, 29871, 13, 29908, 21972, 719, 3850, 2078, 14139, 10515, 1421, 5742, 1075, 29892,

lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new password.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's `wattlebird,\"' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that's not the point - \"\n\u3000\u3000Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after then-t.\n\u3000\u3000\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"\n\u3000\u300084\n\u3000\u3000Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's.\n\u3000\u3000They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but ='\n\u3000\u3000The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"Cool,\" said Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't help it. He grinned, too.\n\u3000\u3000* 85 *\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER Six\n\u3000\u3000GILDEROY LOCKHART\n\u3000\u3000he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls\n\u3000\u300086\n\u3000\u3000streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, he's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not that - it's that.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's - she's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It'll be worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" - he gulped - \"it was horrible.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's a Howler?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.\n\u3000\u3000\"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.\n\u3000\u3000\"-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\"\n\u3000\u3000A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head.\n\u3000\u3000* 88\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.

Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Lupin, startled. \"What's the matter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \"Sh -- she said I'd failed everything!\"\n\u3000\u3000It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.\n\u3000\u3000Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello there, Harry!\" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pity... pity...\"\n\u3000\u3000He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?\" Ron interrupted, stepping forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!\" said Eon stoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off!\"\n\u3000\u3000Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this.... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?\"\n\u3000\u3000The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why'd you stop me?\" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't justice!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like that to his boss!\" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly, they can't possibly execute Buckbeak....\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?\" he asked them unhappily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry. knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.\n\u3000\u3000The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay?\"\n\u3000\u3000But they all refused to say.\n\u3000\u3000\"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a horrible accident!\" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her\" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- \"she's a right old fraud.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock. \"Wish she'd hurry up...\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.\n\u3000\u3000\"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,\" she informed Harry and Ron. \"I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!\"\n\u3000\u3000She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the ladder.\n\u3000\u3000\"How'd it go?\" Harry asked him, standing up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don't think she was convinced, though....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Meet you in the common room,\" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's voice called, \"Harry Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day, my dear,\" she said softly. \"If you would kindly gaze into the Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \"What do you see?\"\n\u3000\u3000The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\" said Harry, \"a dark shape... um...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does it resemble?\" whispered Professor Trelawney. \"Think, now...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000\"A hippogriff,\" he said firmly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed!\" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. \"My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure?\" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure, dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\n\u3000\u3000\"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry again, wanting more than", "input_ids": [1, 6505, 11546, 322, 10515, 1421, 29889, 11546, 1258, 1407, 1532, 2745, 540, 7450, 278, 298, 682, 1478,

Harry straightened up, still holding \nBellatrix\u2019s. \n\n\u201cI said, drop them!\u201d she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione\u2019s throat: \nHarry saw beads of blood appear there. \n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix\u2019s wand onto the floor at his feet, \nRon did the same with Wormtail\u2019s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. \n\n\u201cGood!\u201d she leered. \u201cDraco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry \nPotter! Your death approaches!\u201d \n\nHarry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel \nVoldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he \nwould be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. \n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. \u201cCissy, \nI think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss \nMudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what \nyou have done tonight.\u201d \n\nAt the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them \nlooked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an \nominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, \nshe threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion \nof crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the \nsword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions; Draco doubled \nover, his hands covering his bloody face. \n\n\f\nAs Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance: He \nleapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco\u2019s grip, pointed all of \nthem at Greyback, and yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the \ntriple spell, flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground. \n\nAs Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her \nfeet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand \nat the doorway. \n\n\u201cDobby!\u201d she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. \u201cYou! You dropped the \nchandelier \u2013 ?\u201d \n\nThe tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. \n\n\u201cYou must not hurt Harry Potter,\u201d he squeaked. \n\n\u201cKill him, Cissy!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and \nNarcissa\u2019s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. \n\n\u201cYou dirty little monkey!\u201d bawled Bellatrix. \u201cHow dare you take a witch\u2019s wand, \nhow dare you defy your masters?\u201d \n\n\u201cDobby has no master!\u201d squealed the elf. \u201cDobby is a free elf, and Dobby has \ncome to save Harry Potter and his friends!\u201d \n\nHarry\u2019s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, \nseconds before Voldemort was with them. \n\n\u201cRon, catch \u2013 and GO!\u201d he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent \ndown to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who \nstill clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby\u2019s hand and spun on the \nspot to Disapparate. \n\nAs he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the \npale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron\u2019s hair, and a \nblue of flying silver, as Bellatrix\u2019s knife flew across the room at the place where he was \nvanishing \u2013 \n\nBill and Fleur\u2019s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur\u2019s . . . \n\nHe had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the \ndestination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead \npierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of \nGryffindor\u2019s sword bumping against his back: Dobby\u2019s hand jerked in his; he wondered \nwhether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by \nsqueezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with them. . . . \n\nAnd then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, \nrelinquished Dobby\u2019s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. \n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. \n\nHarry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short \nway away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. \n\n\u201cDobby, is this Shell Cottage?\u201d he whispered, clutching the two wands he had \nbrought from the Malfoys\u2019, ready to fight if he needed to. \u201cHave we come to the right \nplace? Dobby?\u201d \n\nHe looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. \n\n\u201cDOBBY!\u201d \n\nThe elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and \nHarry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf\u2019s heaving chest. \n\n\f\n\u201cDobby \u2013 no \u2013 HELP!\u201d Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people \nmoving there. \u201cHELP!\u201d \n\nHe did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; \nall he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby\u2019s front, and that he \nhad stretched out his own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him \nand laid him sideways on the cool grass. \n\n\u201cDobby, no, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die \u2013\u201c \n\nThe elf\u2019s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. \n\n\u201cHarry . . . Potter . . .\u201d \n\nAnd then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing \nmore than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.\u201d \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Four \n\nThe Wandmaker \n\n \n\nIt was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside \nDumbledore\u2019s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was \nstaring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix\u2019s silver knife. Harry\u2019s \nvoice was still saying, \u201cDobby\u2026Dobby\u2026\u201d even though he knew that the elf had gone \nwhere he could not call him back. \n\n After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for \nhere were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. \n\u201cHermione,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d \n\n\u201cRon\u2019s taken her inside,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Harry looked back down at \nDobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf\u2019s body, then \ndragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby", "input_ids": [1, 963, 29892, 470, 591, 30010, 645, 1074, 3721, 920,

protect you all from something much worse.... We all know what Black's capable of...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,\" said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. \"Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what he was going to become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta,\" said Fudge gruffly. \"The worst he did isn't widely known.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The worst?\" said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity, \"Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly do,\" said Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"I ca'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?\" \"You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,\" mur- mured Professor McGonagall. \"Do you remember who his-best friend was?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Naturally,\" said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. \"Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here -- ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno,\" chuckled Hagrid. \"Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!\" chimed in Professor Flitwick. \"Inseparable!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course they were,\" said Fudge. \"Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Worse even than that, rn'dear....\" Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. \"Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How does that work?\" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"An immensely complex spell,\" he said squeakily, \"involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Naturally,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He suspected Black?\" gasped Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,\" said Professor McGonagall darkly. \"Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But James Potter insisted on using Black?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He did,\" said Fudge heavily. \"And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed --\" \"Black betrayed them?\" breathed Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!\" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"I met him!\" growled Hagrid. \"I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an' James's house after they was killed! jus' got him outta the ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parents dead... an' Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin' motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin' there. I didn' know he'd bin Lily an' James's Secret-Keeper. Thought he'd jus' heard the news o' You-Know-Who's attack an' come ter see what he could do. White an' shakin', he was. An' yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN' TRAITOR!\" Hagrid roared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, please!\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Keep your voice down!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How was I ter know he wasn' upset abou' Lily an' James? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had me orders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an' uncle's. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need it anymore,' he says.\n\u3000\u3000\"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd bin the Potters' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin' ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the Ministry was after him.\n\u3000\u3000\"But what if I'd given Harry to him, eh? I bet he'd 've pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes' friends' son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side, there's nothin' and no one that matters to em anymore....\"\n\u3000\u3000A long silence followed Hagrid's story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, \"But he didn't manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Alas, if only we had,\" said Fudge bitterly. \"It was not we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?\" said Mad", "input_ids": [1, 270, 574, 1847, 263, 3661, 515, 278, 5962, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 29908, 3596, 278, 1021, 1699, 1261, 332, 1127, 383, 566, 479, 29892, 376,

Go and lie down.\u201d \n\n She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing \nto avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside. \n\n Ron\u2019s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the \none above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several \nmoments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddle in the \nentrance. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s You-Know-Who doing?\u201d \n\n Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered \ninto the darkness. \n\n \u201cHe found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.\u201d \n\u201cHow\u2019s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he\u2019s tied up?\u201d \n\n \u201cI dunno. . . . It\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all that he had seen and heard. The more he \nrecalled, the less sense it made. . . . Voldemort had said nothing about Harry\u2019s wand, \nnothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more \npowerful wand to beat Harry\u2019s. . . . \n\n \u201cHe wanted something from Gregorovitch,\u201d Harry said, eyes still closed tight. \n\u201cHe asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and \nthen . . . then . . .\u201d \n\n He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through \nGregorovitch\u2019s eyes, into his memories. . . . \n\n \u201cHe read Gregorovitch\u2019s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a \nwindowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he \nstole whatever You-Know-Who\u2019s after. And I . . . I think I\u2019ve seen him somewhere. . . .\u201d \n\n\f\n Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy\u2019s face. The theft \nhad happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look \nfamiliar? \n\n The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could \nhear was Ron\u2019s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see what the \nthief was holding?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo . . . it must\u2019ve been something small.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry?\u201d \n\n The wooden slats of Ron\u2019s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. \n\n \u201cHarry, you don\u2019t reckon You-Know-Who\u2019s after something else to turn into a \nHorcrux?\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cMaybe. But wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous for him \nto make another one? Didn\u2019t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, but maybe he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah . . .maybe,\u201d said Harry. \n\n He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem \nof the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and \nyet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. \n\n What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the \nWizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that \nGregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? \n\n Harry could still see the blond-haired youth\u2019s face; it was merry, wild; there was a \nFred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the \nwindowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . . \n\n With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and \nit was on him that Harry\u2019s thoughts dwelled, as Ron\u2019s snores began to rumble from the \nlower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more. \n\n \n\nChapter Fifteen \n\nThe Goblin\u2019s Revenge \n\n \n\n Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search \nthe woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could \nfind. There in its shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by \ngouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that \nMad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. \nThen he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were \ngoing to do next. \n\n Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron \nagreed, wit the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon \nsandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the \nclearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground \nthat might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a \nsmall market town. \n\n\f\n Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and \nsurrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the \nInvisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely \nentered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of \nthe skies made him freeze where he stood. \n\n\"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the \ntent empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. \n\n \"I couldn't . . . make one.\" he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \"Wouldn't . . . \ncome.\" \n\nTheir expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had \nbeen a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the \ndistance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming \nfilled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's \nwillpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide \namongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the \ndespair they cast wherever they went. \n\n \"So we still haven't got any food.\" \n\n \"Shut up, Ron,\" snapped Hermione. \"Harry, what happened? Why do you think \nyou couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\" \n\n \"I don't know.\" \n\n He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the \nmoment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a \nlong time ago: Today me might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who \ncollapsed on the Hogwarts Express. \n\n Ron kicked a chair leg. \n\n \"What?\" he snarled at Hermione. \"I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to \ndeath is a couple of toadstools!\" \n\n \"You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\" said Harry, stung. \n\n \"I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!\" \n\n \"That's convenient.\" \n\n \"And what's that supposed to \u2014 ?\" \n\n \"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both \nof them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket! Come on,\" she said impatiently, clicking \nher fingers at him when he did not react,\" to Horcrux, Harry, you", "input_ids": [1, 6505, 8530, 29871, 13, 13, 1346, 3782, 29892, 366, 30010, 276, 12879,

Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for \nsomething to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a \nmost familiar voice was issuing. \n\n\u201c\u2026apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a \nnumber of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s Lee Jordan!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cI know!\u201d beamed Ron. \u201cCool, eh?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026now found ourselves another secure location,\u201d Lee was saying, and I\u2019m \npleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. \nEvening, boys!\u201d \n\n\u201cHi.\u201d \n\n\u201cEvening, River.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2019River\u2019\u201d that\u2019s Lee,\u201d Ron explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got code names, but you can \nusually tell ---\u201c \n\n\u201cShh!\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cBut before we hear from Royal and Romulus,\u201d Lee went on, \u201clet\u2019s take a \nmoment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily \nProphet don\u2019t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform \nour listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.\u201d \n\nHarry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one \nanother in horror. \n\n\u201cA goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born \nDean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, \nCresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any \nknowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. \n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their \nhome. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the \nOrder of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it \nwere needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational \nsport under the new regime. \n\n\u201cFinally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot \nhave been discovered in Godric\u2019s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months \nago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of \ninjuries inflicted by Dark Magic. \n\n\u201cListeners, I\u2019d like to invite you now to join us in a minute\u2019s silence in memory of \nTed Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less \nregretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\u201d \n\nSilence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned \nto hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had \nfelt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. \n\n\f\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lee\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd now we can return to regular contributor \nRoyal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. \n\n\u201cKingsley!\u201d burst out Ron. \n\n\u201cWe know!\u201d said Hermione, hushing him. \n\n\u201cMuggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to \nsustain heavy casualties,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cHowever, we continue to hear truly \ninspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle \nfriends and neighbors, often without the Muggles\u2019 knowledge. I\u2019d like to appeal to all our \nlisteners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any \nMuggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are \ntaken.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these \ndangerous times, it should be \u2018Wizards first\u2019? asked Lee. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that it\u2019s one short step from \u2018Wizards first\u2019 to \u2018Purebloods first,\u2019 and then \nto \u2018Death Eaters,\u2019\u201d replied Kingsley. \u201cWe\u2019re all human, aren\u2019t we? Every human life is \nworth the same, and worth saving.\u201d \n\n\u201cExcellently put, Royal, and you\u2019ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever \nget out of this mess,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd now, over to Romulus for our popular feature \u2018Pals \nof Potter.\u2019\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but \nHermione forestalled him in a whisper. \n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s Lupin!\u201d \n\n\u201cRomulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you\u2019ve appeared on our \nprogram, that Harry Potter is still alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cThere is no doubt at all in my mind that his death \nwould be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, \nbecause it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. \n\u2018The Boy Who Lived\u2019 remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the \ntriumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\u201d \n\nA mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, \nthen, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? \n\n\u201cAnd what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him we\u2019re all with him in spirit,\u201d said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, \n\u201cAnd I\u2019d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\u201d \n\nHarry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. \n\n\u201cNearly always right,\u201d she repeated. \n\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d said Ron in surprise. \u201cBill told me Lupin\u2019s living with \nTonks again! And apparently she\u2019s getting pretty big too\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter\u2019s who are suffering for \ntheir allegiance?\u201d Lee was saying. \n\n \u201cWell, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of \nHarry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile \neditor of The Quibbler,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n \u201cAt least he\u2019s still alive!\u201d muttered Ron. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\u201d \u2013", "input_ids":

And when you\u2019re dressed, there\u2019s luggage in the other sack.\u201d \n\n The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever \nseen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers \nrummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own \nthings away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all \nbegan stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than \nthey would have been with their own. \n\n \u201cI knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\u201d said Ron, looking down at his bare \nchest. \n\n \u201cHarry, your eyesight really is awful,\u201d said Hermione, as she put on glasses. \n\n Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a \nstuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden \nHarrys faced him. \u201cThe pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, \nby broom \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWhy\u2019m I with you?\u201d grunted the Harry nearest the back door. \n\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re the one that needs watching,\u201d growled Moody, and sure enough, \nhis magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \u201cArthur and Fred \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m George,\u201d said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \u201cCan\u2019t you even tell \nus apart when we\u2019re Harry?\u201d \n\n \u201cSorry, George \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m only yanking your wand, I\u2019m Fred really \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cEnough messing around!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cThe other one \u2013 George or Fred or \nwhoever you are \u2013 you\u2019re with Remus. Miss Delacour \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m taking Fleur on a thestral,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019s not that fond of brooms.\u201d \n\n Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that \nHarry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again. \n\n \u201cMiss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral \u2013\u201c \n\n Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley\u2019s smile; Harry knew that \nHermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick. \n\n \u201cWhich leaves you and me, Ron!\u201d said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree \nas she waved at him. \n\n Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. \n\n \u201cAn\u2019 you\u2019re with me, Harry. That all righ\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be on the bike, brooms an\u2019 thestrals can\u2019t take me weight, see. Not a lot o\u2019 room \non the seat with me on it, though, so you\u2019ll be in the sidecar.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Harry, not altogether truthfully. \n\n \u201cWe think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\u201d said Moody, who \nseemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \u201cSnape\u2019s had plenty of time to tell them \neverything about you he\u2019s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, \nwe\u2019re betting they\u2019ll choose one of the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All \nright then,\u201d he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters\u2019 clothes in it and leading \n\n\f\nthe way back to the door, \u201cI make it three minutes until we\u2019re supposed to leave. No \npoint locking the back door, it won\u2019t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. \nCome on \u2026\u201d \n\n Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig\u2019s cage and followed \nthe group to the dark back garden. \n\n On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been \nhelped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid \nwas standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. \n\n \u201cIs this it? Is this Sirius\u2019s bike?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe very same,\u201d said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \u201cAn\u2019 the last time yeh \nwas on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\u201d \n\n Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It \nplaced him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting \nthere like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his \nfeet and rammed Hedwig\u2019s cage between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. \n\n \u201cArthur\u2019s done a bit o\u2019 tinkerin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry\u2019s \ndiscomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank \ninches into the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s got a few tricks up its sleeves now. Tha\u2019 one was my idea.\u201d \nHe pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. \n\n\"Please be careful, Hagrid.\" said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, \nholding his broomstick. \"I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be \nused in emergencies.\" \n\n\"All right, then.\" said Moody. \"Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at \nexactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost.\" \n\nEverybody motioned their heads. \n\n\"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at \nLupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike \ninto life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. \n\n \u201cGood luck, everyone,\u201d shouted Moody. \u201cSee you all in about an hour at the \nBurrow. On the count of three. One \u2026 two .. THREE.\u201d \n\n There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty \nlurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off \nhis face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral \nflicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig\u2019s cage and his rucksack, were \nalready sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to \ntake a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. By the time he looked over the edge of \nthe sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. \n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty \nhooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the \nOrder members had risen, oblivious \u2013 \n\nScreams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the \nmotorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, \nyells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, \nand his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees \u2013 \n\n\"No \u2013 HELP!\" \n\n\f\nThe broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack \nand the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, \nand then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. \n\n\"No \u2013 NO!\" \n\nThe motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering \nas Hagrid blasted through their circle. \n\n\"Hedwig \u2013 Hedwig \u2013\" \n\nBut the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage.

and looked down.\n\u3000\u3000At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again.... Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\"\n\u3000\u3000Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to die.... She was going to be murdered....\n\u3000\u3000He was falling, falling through the icy mist.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....\n\u3000\u3000A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lucky the ground was so soft.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought he was dead for sure.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he didn't even break his glasses.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there, or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\u3000\u3000Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ... screaming...\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud. \"How're you feeling?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning -- the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"You fell off,\" said Fred. \"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We thought you'd died,\" said Alicia, who was shaking.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.\n\u3000\u3000\"But the match,\" said Harry. \"What happened? Are we doing a replay?\"\n\u3000\u3000No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't -- lose?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is Wood?\" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Still in the showers,\" said Fred. \"We think he's trying to drown himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There had to be one time you didn't get it,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not over yet,\" said Fred. \"We lost by a hundred points\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin --.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if they beat Ravenclaw...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.\n\u3000\u3000After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll come and see you later,\" Fred told him. \"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had.\"\n\u3000\u3000The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore was really angry,\" Hermione said in a quaking voice. \"I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away... He was furious they'd come onto the grounds. We heard him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,\" said Ron. \"And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did someone get my Nimbus?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, looking from one to the other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,\" said Hermione hesitantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\n\u3000\u3000\"And?\" he said, dreading the answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It -- it doesn't like being hit.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice.\n\u3000\u3000Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TEN\n\u3000\u3000THE MARAUDER'S MAP\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best friends.\n\u3000\u3000He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn't blame\n\u3000\u3000him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him.\n\u3000\u3000He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?\n\u3000\u3000And then there were the dementors.

go down and see him. It's still quite early...\"\n\u3000\u3000I don't know,\" Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, \" he said Pointedly. \"Sirius Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he?\"\n\u3000\u3000So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirely sure they were supposed to be out.\n\u3000\u3000The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, \"C'min.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Spect it's a record,\" he said thickly, when he recognized them. \"Don' reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!\" gasped Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not yet,\" said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard. \"But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How is he?\" said Ron as they all sat down. \"It wasn't serious, was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,\" said Hagrid dully, \"but he's sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..\n\u3000\u3000\"He's faking it, \" said Harry at once. \"Madam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's worth.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course,\" said Hagrid miseribly. \"They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done flobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all my fault....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!\" said Hermione earnestly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're witnesses,\" said Harry. \"You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tell Dumbledore what really happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid,\" said Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.\n\u3000\u3000\"At, maybe she's right,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud splash.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's he done?\" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stuck his head in the water barrel,\" said Hermione, putting the tankard away.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's better,\" he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all. \"Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he'd only just realized he was there.\n\u3000\u3000\"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?\" he roared, so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air. \"YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTER DARK, HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon!\" Hagrid said angrily. \"I'm takin' yer all back up ter school, an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm not worth that!\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SEVEN\n\u3000\u3000THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.\n\u3000\u3000\"How is it, Draco?\" simpered Pansy Parkinson. \"Does it hurt much?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Settle down, settle down,\" said Professor Snape idly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said \"settle down\" if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention. But Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape's classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his own students above all others.\n\u3000\u3000They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir,\" Malfoy called, \"sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him,\" said Snape without looking up.\n\u3000\u3000Ron went brick red.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing wrong with your arm,\" he hissed at Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy smirked across the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" drawled Malfoy, \"Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But, sit --!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\n\u3000\u3000Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\n\u3000\u3000\"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned,\" said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig,\" said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?\" he asked them quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"None of your business,\" said Ron jerkily, without looking up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer,\" said Malfoy", "input_ids": [1, 351, 2429, 29915, 29879, 3474, 1699, 10686, 1497, 11584, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 29934, 265, 5148,

You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a \nseventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!\" \n\n\"It's time you earned it.\" said Harry. \n\nThe floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the \nsitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. \n\n\"We --- we thought we heard --\" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed \nat the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. \n\n\"\u2014raised voices,\" panted Mrs. Weasley. \n\nScrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had \nmade in Harry's T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. \n\n\"It \u2013 it was nothing,\" he growled. \"I \u2026 regret your attitude,\" he said, looking \nHarry full in the face once more. \"You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire \nwhat you \u2013 what Dumbledore \u2013 desired. We ought to work together.\" \n\n\"I don't like your methods, Minister,\" said Harry. \"Remember?\" \n\nFor the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar \nthat still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's \nexpression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. \nMrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or \nso she called, \"He's gone!\" \n\nWhat did he want?\" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and \nHermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them. \n\n\"To give us what Dumbledore left us,\" said Harry. \"They've only just released the \ncontent of his will.\" \n\nOutside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had \ngiven them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator \nand The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to \npass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore \nwould have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the \nthird of fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, \"Harry, dear, everyone's awfully \nhungry we didn't like to start without you\u2026 Shall I serve dinner now?\" \n\nThey all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of \"Happy Birthday\" \nand much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding \nthe following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set \nup a tent for himself in a neighboring field. \n\n\"Meet us upstairs,\" Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. \nWeasley restore the garden to its normal state. \"After everyone's gone to bed.\" \n\nUp in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's \nmokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless \nthough some of them were the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, \nand R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then \nsat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped \non the door and tiptoed inside. \n\n\"Muffiato,\" she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. \n\n\"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?\" said Ron. \n\n\"Times change,\" said Hermione. \"Now, show us that Deluminator.\" \n\n\f\nRon obliged at once. Holding I up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp \nthey had lit went out at once. \n\n\"The thing is,\" whispered Hermione through the dark, \"we could have achieved \nthat with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\" \n\nThere was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the \nceiling and illuminated them all once more. \n\n\"Still, it's cool,\" said Ron, a little defensively. \"And from what they said, \nDumbledore invented it himself!\" \n\n\"I know but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us \nturn out the lights!\" \n\n\"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine \neverything he'd left us?\" asked Harry. \n\n\"Definitely,\" said Hermione. \"He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving \nus these things, but that will doesn't explain\u2026\" \n\n\"\u2026 why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"Well, exactly,\" said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the \nBard. \"If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the \nMinistry, you'd think he'd have left us know why\u2026 unless he thought it was obvious?\" \n\n\"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?\" said Ron. \"I always said he was mental. \nBrilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch \u2013 what the hell was \nthat about?\" \n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Hermione. \"When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was \nso sure that something was going to happen!\" \n\n\"Yeah, well,\" said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. \n\"I wasn't going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour was I?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione. \n\n\"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\" said Harry. \"Don't you \nremember?\" \n\nHermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically \nfrom Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice. \n\n\"That was the one you nearly swallowed!\" \n\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the \nSnitch. \n\nIt did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He \nlowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. \n\n\"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!\" \nHe nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. \nEngraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, \nwere five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry recognized as \nDumbledore's \n\nI open at the close. \n\nHe had barely read them when the words vanished again. \n\n\"I open at the close\u2026.\" What's that supposed to mean?\" \n\nHermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. \n\n\"I open at the close\u2026 at the close\u2026 I open at the close\u2026\" \n\n\f\nBut no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, \nthey were unable to wring any more meaning from them. \n\n\"And the sword,\" said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts \nto divine meaning in the Snitch's inscription. \n\n\"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?\" \n\n\"And why couldn't he just have told me?\" Harry said quietly. \"I was there, it was \nright there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have \nit, why didn't he just give it to me then?\" \n\nHe felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to \nhave been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there \nsomething he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know \nwhat", "input_ids": [1, 29879, 3700, 29889, 376, 7301, 1096, 287, 393, 306, 626, 451, 360, 25443, 487, 29892, 1058, 18879, 1351, 596, 1663, 324, 663, 29871, 13, 13, 15, 13, 392,

Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You \ncould get out the tent, Harry. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cTent?\u201d \n\n \u201cIn the bag!\u201d \n\n \u201cIn the . . . of course,\u201d said Harry. \n\n He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. \nThe tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, ropes, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly \nbecause of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the \nQuidditch World Cup. \n\n \u201cI thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?\u201d he asked, starting \nto disentangle the pent pegs. \n\n \u201cApparently he didn\u2019t want it back, his lumbago\u2019s so bad,\u201d said Hermione, now \nperforming complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand. \u201cso Ron\u2019s dad said I \ncould borrow it. Erecto!\u201d she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in \none fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before \nHarry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end \nof a guy rope. \n\n \u201cCave Inimicum,\u201d Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as \nI can do. At the very least, we should know they\u2019re coming; I can\u2019t guarantee it will keep \nout Vol \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t say the name!\u201d Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. \n\n Harry and Hermione looked at each other. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, \u201cbut it \nfeels like a \u2013 a jinx or something. Can\u2019t we call him You-Know-Who \u2013 please?\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore said fear of a name \u2013\u201c began Harry. \n\n \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn\u2019t do \nDumbledore much good in the end,\u201d Ron snapped back. \u201cJust \u2013 just show You-Know-\nWho some respect, will you?\u201d \n\n \u201cRespect?\u201d Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he \nwas not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. \n\n Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the \ntent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with \nbathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully \nonto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter \nstill, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not \nspeak for a while. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ll make some tea,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from \nthe depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. \n\n\f\n Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that \nMad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After \na minute or two, Ron broke the silence. \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?\u201d \n\n \u201cWith any luck, they\u2019ll have got away,\u201d said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for \ncomfort. \u201cAs long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he\u2019ll have transported Mrs. \nCattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they\u2019ll be fleeing the country right now with \ntheir children. That\u2019s what Harry told her to do.\u201d \n\n \u201cBlimey, I hope they escaped,\u201d said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea \nseemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the feeling \nReg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me \nwhen I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of \nus . . .\u201d \n\n Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask \u2013 about \nwhether Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her \nhusband \u2013 died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the \nCattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if \nhe had surprised her in the act of kissing him. \n\n \u201cSo, have you got it?\u201d Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there. \n\n \u201cGot \u2013 got what?\u201d she said with a little start. \n\n \u201cWhat did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where\u2019s the locket?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou got it?\u201d shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. \u201cNo one \ntells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!\u201d \n\u201cWell, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren\u2019t we?\u201d said \nHermione. \u201cHere.\u201d \n\n And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. \n\n It was as large as a chicken\u2019s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green \nstones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent\u2019s canvas roof. \n\n \u201cThere isn\u2019t any chance someone\u2019s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?\u201d asked \nRon hopefully. \u201cI mean, are we sure it\u2019s still a Horcrux?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think so,\u201d said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. \n\u201cThere\u2019d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.\u201d \n\n She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, \npristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the \nHorcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. \n\n \u201cI reckon Kreacher\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work out how to \nopen this thing before we can destroy it.\u201d \n\n Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden \ndoors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to \nfling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with \nhis fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus\u2019s bedroom \ndoor. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom \ndid their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. \n\n \u201cCan you feel it, though?\u201d Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his \nclenched fist. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d \nRon passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew \nwhat Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or \nwas it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart? \n\n \u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d Hermione asked. \n\n \u201cKeep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.\u201d Harry replied, and, little though \nhe wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight \nbeneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given \nhim. \n\n \u201cI think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,\u201d he added to \nHermione, standing up and stretching. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need to think about some food as well. \nYou stay there,\u201d he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of \ngreen. \n\n With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully \nupon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role \nof lookout.

{"text": "\u3000\"How on earth d'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you'd wiped slime off a name for an hour, you'd remember it, too.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn't the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel's birthday, or dentist, half-past three.\n\u3000\u3000\"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.\n\u3000\u3000*231 *\n\u3000\u3000\"He must've been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfufly. \"To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it's not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle's nose.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, however, pocketed it.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle's diary and told her the story of how they had found it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely.\n\u3000\u3000\"If it has, it's hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it's shy. I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor .....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?\" he said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000*232*\n\u3000\u3000a so?\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in his diary.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\n\u3000\u3000\"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered.\n\u3000\u3000She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\"\n\u3000\u3000Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though\n\u3000\u3000* 233 *\n\u3000\u3000Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\n\u3000\u3000Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.\n\u3000\u3000\"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice.\n\u3000\u3000The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\"\n\u3000\u3000* 243 *\n\u3000\u3000Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years ....\n\u3000\u3000Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match.\n\u3000\u3000Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He tapped his nose again and strode off.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late- running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors.\n\u3000\u3000The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse\n\u3000\u3000* 235*\n\u3000\u3000still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Herm", "input_ids": [1, 30358, 29908, 5328, 373, 8437, 270, 29915, 6293, 1073, 393, 3026, 1497, 10686, 297, 21863,

"dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\" said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid's record's against him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. \"I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. \"Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; he'd let out an audible gasp.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.\n\u3000\u3000\"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doin' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \"but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed, \"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now\n\u3000\u3000262\n\u3000\u3000\"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as all twelve of us have voted -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -\" stuttered Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\"growled Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones.\n\u3000\u3000\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will\n\u3000\u3000* 26$*\n\u3000\u3000ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\n\u3000\u3000* 265*\n\u3000\u3000that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\n\u3000\u3000Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.\n\u3000\u3000One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever\n\u3000\u3000*266*\n\u3000\u3000had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in ......\n\u3000\u3000Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty", "input_ids": [1, 13700, 964, 697, 310, 670, 521, 7121, 322,

whisper. \"I haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!\" And-he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?\" said a cold, drawling voice.\n\u3000\u3000Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?\" said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in case you get too near a dementor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then it could catch the Snitch for you.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's broom really was a Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what we've got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just -- just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year's World Championship --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?\" interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information -- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.\n\u3000\u3000\"Show her your acceleration, Harry!\" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.\n\u3000\u3000Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet away --\n\u3000\u3000Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.\n\u3000\u3000There was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn -- Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance is really noticeable in these long --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --\n\u3000\u3000Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --\n\u3000\u3000\"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\" Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \"KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him.... She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to take the consequences....\n\u3000\u3000He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.\n\u3000\u3000He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second -- then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh!\" screamed Cho, pointing.\n\u3000\u3000Distracted, Harry looked down.\n\u3000\u3000Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at him.\n\u3000\u3000He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, \"Expecto patronum!\"\n\u3000\u3000Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the ro", "input_ids": [1, 1497, 2431, 1270, 29892, 297, 385, 5065, 5362, 21039, 29889, 376, 29902, 7359, 29915, 29873, 2355, 3006, 402, 3498, 787, 29889, 3869, 29892, 306,

The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges.\n\u3000\u3000* -L 5,5\n\u3000\u3000Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall. When she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is a girls' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. \"They're not girls.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wasn't paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully.\n\u3000\u3000* IL 56*\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle .... Come on, let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.\n\u3000\u3000\"RON!\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a girls' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don't you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why shouldn't we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now\n\u3000\u3000*157*\n\u3000\u3000reddening. \"You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I'll write to Mum!\"\n\u3000\u3000And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you're talking about Malfoy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You'll be next, Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it's him -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin's descendants. His father's definitely evil enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000*158*\n\u3000\u3000\"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\" said Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it's possible ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you?\" said Ron irritably.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron.\n\u3000",

It's obvious. Wish Dobby'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I've read about Chameleon Ghouls -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your\n\u3000\u3000arm\t\tHe shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn't\n\u3000\u3000stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you.\"\n\u3000\u3000*184*\n\u3000\u3000The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.\n\u3000\u3000Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure- blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.\n\u3000\u3000\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib.\"\n\u3000\u3000In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.\n\u3000\u3000Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still\n\u3000\u3000* 3-85*\n\u3000\u3000needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harry privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.\n\u3000\u3000\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\n\u3000\u3000Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\n\u3000\u3000Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say \"Unfair.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery\n\u3000\u3000*186*\n\u3000\u3000potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded.\n\u3000\u3000Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office.\n\u3000\u3000\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\n\u3000\u3000When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\n\u3000\u3000*187*\n\u3000\u3000\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make sure that person is expelled.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.\n\u3000\u3000\"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"I could tell.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape can't prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \"What can he do?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.\n\u3000\u3000A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days ......\n\u3000\u3000\"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. \"Shall we go?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that\n\u3000\u3000*188*\n\u3000\u3000evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety", "input_ids": [1, 945, 29877, 920, 304, 437, 372, 29889, 739, 29915, 29879, 6924, 29889, 399, 728, 21451, 1609, 29915, 29881, 5429, 366, 825, 2924, 310, 1601, 2475, 29915,

and \ndarting so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting on of \ntheir own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, \nlooking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeee!\" \nand looking up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping \nSnargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were \nsuddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \n\"ARGH!\" \nA fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp \ngreen roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to \nshake them loose. \n\"Someone's invisible there!\" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. \nDean made the most of the Death Eater's momentary distraction, \nknocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to \n\n\f\nretaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. \n\"LET'S GO!\" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the \nCloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the \nmidst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff \njuice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance \nhall. \n\"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!\" \nDraco was on the upper landing, pleading with anoter masked Death \nEater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked \naround, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the \nCloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth \nbleeding, utterly bemused. \n\"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two- \nfaced bastard!\" Ron yelled. \nThere were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death \nEaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, \nin combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley \nright beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying \nor dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell \ntoward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, \nwho had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous \nTentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death \nEater and began reeling him in. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass \nshattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had \nrecorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that \npeople slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the \nbalcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry \ntook for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its \nteeth into one of the fallen. \n\"NO!\" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, \nFenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body \nof Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to \nreturn to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a \ncrystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground \nand did not move. \n\"I have more!\" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the \nbanisters. \"More for any who want them! Here--\" \nAnd with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous \ncrystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and \ncaused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a \nwindow. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst \nopen, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the \nfront hall. \nScreams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death \nEaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew \n\n\f\ninto the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and \nreared, more terrifying than ever. \n\"How do we get out?\" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before \neither Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; \nHagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery \npink umbrella. \n\"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!\" he yelled. \n\"HAGRID, NO!\" \nHarry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, \nrunning bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. \n\"HAGRID, COME BACK!\" \nBut he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid \nvanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul \nswarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, \nHagrid buried in their midst. \n\"HAGRID!\" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend \nor foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into \nthe dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their \nprey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. \n\"HAGRID!\" \nHe thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist \nof the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way \nwas impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the \ndarkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked \nup: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in \nshadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light \nfrom the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed \na massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon \nHarryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. \n\"Oh my--!\" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry \nand gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through \nthe window above. \n\"DON'T!\" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her \nwand. \"Stun him and he'll crush half the castle--\" \n\"HAGGER?\" \nGrawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did \nHarry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The \ngargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors \nturned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he \nstomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell \nopen, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they \nlaunched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. \n\"RUN!\" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows \nas the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down \nthe steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not \nlost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they \n\n\f\nwere halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short \nagain. \nThe air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and \nsolidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling \nfigures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards \nthe castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... \nron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting \nbehind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only \ndementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and \nFred was gone, and Hagrid was suurely dying or already dead... \n\"come on, Harry!\" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away.

\u201cwell-known gamekeeper at \nHogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he \nis rumored to have hosted a \u2018Support Harry Potter\u2019 party in his house. However, Hagrid \nwas not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.\u201d \n\n \u201cI suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you\u2019ve got a sixteen-\nfoot-high half brother?\u201d asked Lee. \n\n \u201cIt would tend to give you an edge,\u201d agreed Lupin gravely. \u201cMay I just add that \nwhile we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid\u2019s spirit, we would urge even the most \ndevoted of Harry\u2019s supporters against following Hagrid\u2019s lead. \u2018Support Harry Potter\u2019 \nparties are unwise in the present climate.\u201d \n\n \u201cIndeed they are, Romulus,\u201d said Lee, \u201cso we suggest that you continue to show \nyour devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now \nlet\u2019s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. \nWe like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of \nthe more insane rumors circulating about him, I\u2019d like to introduce a new correspondent. \nRodent?\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2019Rodent\u2019?\u201d said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried \nout together: \n\n \u201cFred!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 is it George?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s Fred, I think,\u201d said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not being \u2018Rodent,\u2019 no way, I told you I wanted to be \u2018Rapier\u2019!\u201d \n\n \u201cOh, all right then, \u2018Rapier,\u2019 could you please give us your take on the various \nstories we\u2019ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, River, I can,\u201d said Fred. \u201cAs our listeners will know, unless they\u2019ve taken \nrefuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who\u2019s strategy \nof remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the \nalleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos \nrunning around the place.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhich suits him, of course,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cThe air of mystery is creating more \nterror than actually showing himself.\u201d \n\n \u201cAgreed,\u201d said Fred. \u201cSo, people, let\u2019s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad \nenough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who \ncan kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That\u2019s a basilisk, listeners. One simple \ntest: Check whether the thing that\u2019s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it\u2019s safe to look \ninto its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that\u2019s still likely to be the last thing \nyou ever do.\u201d \n\n For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the \nweight of tension leaving him. \n\n \u201cAnd the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?\u201d asked Lee. \n\n \u201cWell, who wouldn\u2019t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he\u2019s been \nputting in?\u201d asked Fred. \u201cPoint is, people, don\u2019t get lulled into a false sense of security, \nthinking he\u2019s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn\u2019t, but the fact remains he can \nmove faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don\u2019t \n\n\f\ncount on him being a long way away if you\u2019re planning to take any risks. I never thought \nI\u2019d hear myself say it, but safety first!\u201d \n\n \u201cThank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\u201d said Lee. \u201dListeners, that \nbrings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don\u2019t know when it will be possible to \nbroadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The \nnext password will be \u2018Mad-Eye.\u2019 Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\u201d \n\n The radio\u2019s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, \nRon, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an \nextraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten \nthat other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. \n\n \u201cGood, eh?\u201d said Ron happily. \n\n \u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s so brave of them,\u201d sighed Hermione admiringly. \u201cIf they were found \u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, they keep on the move, don\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron. \u201cLike us.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut did you hear what Fred said?\u201d asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was \nover, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. \u201cHe\u2019s abroad! He\u2019s \nstill looking for the Wand, I knew it!\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry\u2014\u201c \n\n \u201cCome on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHARRY, NO!\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014demort\u2019s after the Elder Wand!\u201d \n\n \u201cThe name\u2019s Taboo!\u201d Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded \noutside the tent. \u201cI told you, Harry, I told you, we can\u2019t say it anymore \u2013 we\u2019ve got to put \nthe protection back around us \u2013 quickly \u2013 it\u2019s how they find \u2013\u201c \n\n But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had \nlit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited \nvoices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. \n\n \u201cCome out of there with your hands up!\u201d came a rasping voice through the \ndarkness. \u201cWe know you\u2019re in there! You\u2019ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and \nwe don\u2019t care who we curse!\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Three \n\nMalfoy Manor \n\n \n\nHarry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw \nHermione point her wand, set toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a \nburst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face \nswelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. \n\n \"Get up, vermin.\" \n\n Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, \nsomeone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry \nclutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, \ntight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His \n\n\f\neyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he \nwas bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five \npeople wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too. \n\n \"Get -- off - her!\" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles \nhitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, \"No! Leave him alone, leave \nhim alone!\" \n\n \"Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list,\" \nsaid the horribly familiar, rasping voice. \"Delicious girl... what a treat . . . I do enjoy the \nsoftness of the skin. . . .\" \n\n Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the \nwerewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery. \n\n \"Search the tent!\" said another voice. \n\n Harry was thrown face", "input_ids": [1, 599, 2211, 310, 29871, 13, 386, 331, 330, 4692, 287, 29892, 322, 577, 8886, 13726, 278, 1791, 310, 278, 10541, 1192, 1346, 5872, 29899, 5203, 3748, 23935, 472, 29871, 13,

He's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says she'll be able to make him better. Quick -- go --\"\n\u3000\u3000But Black was still staring down at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"How can I ever thank --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"GO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted together.\n\u3000\u3000Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll see each other again,\" he said. \"You are -- truly your father's son, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000He squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more.... The hippogriff took off into the air.... He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon.... They were gone.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\n\u3000\u3000OWL POST AGAIN\n\u3000\u3000Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. \"We've got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, \"let's go....\"\n\u3000\u3000They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties,\" Snape was saying. \"The Kiss will be performed immediately?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... I daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's back in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps died away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase, then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peeves!\" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. \"In here!\"\n\u3000\u3000They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he's horrible,\" whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. \"I bet he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius....\" She checked her watch. \"Three minutes, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance, then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before Dumbledore locks the door?\" Harry panted.\n\u3000\u3000I don't want to think about it!\" Hermione moaned, checking her watch again. \"One minute!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance. \"Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,\" said Hermione tensely. \"Come on, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back appeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am going to lock you in,\" they heard him saying. \"it is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache. \"Well?\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We did it!\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak....\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore beamed at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done. I think --\" He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing. \"Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock you in --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?\"\n\u3000\u3000She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them....\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that?\" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\n\u3000\u3000Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer --\n\u3000\u3000\"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!\" Snape roared, now very close at hand. \"YOU CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS -- SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --\"\n\u3000\u3000BAM.\n\u3000\u3000The door of the hospital wing burst open.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!\" he bellowed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape!\" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. \"Control yourself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Snape, be reasonable,\" said Fudge. \"This door's been locked, we just saw --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!\" Snape howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Calm down, man!\" Fudge barked. \"You're talking nonsense!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!\" shrieked Snape. \"HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Think about what you are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course not!\" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. \"I would have heard them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there you have it, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fellow seems quite unbalanced,\" said Fudge, staring after him. \"I'd watch out for him", "input_ids": [1,

The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon \nhim, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . . \n\n \u201cSo, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was \npointless. I never had it.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou lie!\u201d \n\n As Voldemort\u2019s anger throbbed inside him, Harry\u2019s scar threatened to burst with \npain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the \nprisoners were pushed over gravel. \n\n\f\n Light spilled out over all of them. \n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d said a woman\u2019s cold voice. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\u201d rasped Greyback. \n\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou know me!\u201d There was resentment in the werewolf\u2019s voice. \u201cFenrit \nGreyback! We\u2019ve caught Harry Potter!\u201d \n\n Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other \nprisoners to shuffle around too. \n\n \u201cI know \u2018es swollen, ma\u2019am, but it\u2019s \u2018im!\u201d piped up Scabior. \u201cIf you look a bit \ncloser, you\u2019ll see \u2018is scar. And this \u2018ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who\u2019s been traveling \naround with \u2018im, ma\u2019am. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s \u2018im, and we\u2019ve got \u2018is wand as well! \u2018Ere, \nma\u2019am \u2013\u201c \n\n Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen \nface. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows. \n\n \u201cBring them in,\u201d she said. \n\n Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway \nlined with portraits. \n\n \u201cFollow me,\u201d said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. \u201cMy son, Draco, is \nhome for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.\u201d \n\n The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost \nclosed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung \nfrom the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from \nchairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by \nthe Snatchers. \n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \n\n The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry\u2019s ears. He \nwas panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to \nblock out Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. \n\n \u201cThey say they\u2019ve got Potter,\u201d said Narcissa\u2019s cold voice. \u201cDraco, come here.\u201d \nHarry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly \ntaller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath \nwhite-blond hair. \n\n Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath \nthe chandelier. \n\n \u201cWell, boy?\u201d rasped the werewolf. \n\n Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately \nscrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time \nsince leaving Grimmauld Place. \n\n His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione\u2019s jinx. \nHis black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he \nnot known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his \nglasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still \navoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached. \n\n \u201cWell, Draco?\u201d said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. \u201cIs it? Is it Harry Potter?\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t be sure,\u201d said Draco. He was keeping his distance from \nGreyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him. \n\n\f\n \u201cBut look at him carefully, look! Come closer!\u201d \n\n Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. \n\n \u201cDraco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will \nbe forgiv \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cNow, we won\u2019t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?\u201d said \nGreyback menacingly. \n\n \u201cOf course not, of course not!\u201d said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry \nhimself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail \neven through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was \npeering out from between the bars of a cage. \n\n \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Lucius asked Greyback. \u201cHow did he get into this \nstate?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat wasn\u2019t us.\u201d \n\u201cLooks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,\u201d said Lucius. \n\n His gray eyes raked Harry\u2019s forehead. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s something there,\u201d he whispered. \u201cit could be the scar, stretched \ntight. . . .\u201d Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?\u201d \n\n Harry saw Draco\u2019s face up close now, right beside his father\u2019s. They were \nextraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, \nDraco\u2019s expression was full of reluctance, even fear. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his \nmother stood watching. \n\n \u201cWe had better be certain, Lucius,\u201d Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, \nclear voice. \u201cCompletely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They \nsay this is his\u201d \u2013 she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand \u2013 \u201cbut it does not \nresemble Ollivander\u2019s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here \nfor nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat about the Mudblood, then?\u201d growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown \noff his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light \nfell on Hermione instead. \n\n \u201cWait,\u201d said Narcissa sharply. \u201cYes \u2013 yes, she was in Madam Malkin\u2019s with \nPotter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn\u2019t it the Granger girl?\u201d \n\n \u201cI . . . maybe . . . yeah.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut then, that\u2019s the Weasley boy!\u201d shouted Lucius, striding around the bound \nprisoners to face Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s them, Potter\u2019s friends \u2013 Draco, look at him, isn\u2019t it Arthur \nWeasley\u2019s son, what\u2019s his name \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. \u201cIt could be.\u201d \n\n The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of \nthe voice wound Harry\u2019s fear to an even higher pitch. \n\n \u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happened, Cissy?\u201d \n\n Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry\u2019s \nright, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes, \n\n \u201cBut surely,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cthis is the Mudblood girl? This is Grander?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s Granger!\u201d cried Lucius, \u201cAnd beside her, we think, Potter! Potter \nand his friends, caught at last!\u201d \n\u201cPotter?\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. \n\n\f\n\u201cAre you sure?

As the three of them looked away \nfrom him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He \nlaunched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as \n\n\f\nXenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. \nThere was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart. \nFragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an \nimpenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the \nfloor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard \nHermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him \nthat Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. \nHalf buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. \nHalf of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna's bead was hanging through the hole. \nThe bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of \ntorn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, \nblocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, \nand Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to her lips. \nThe door downstairs crashed open. \n\"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell \nyou this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from \nXenophilius. \n\"No...no...upstairs...Potter!\" \n\"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some \nsolid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for \nthat stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" -- Another bang, another squeal -- \n\"When you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple\" -- Bang \n-- \"Headed\"--bang--\"Snorkacks?\" \n\"No -- no -- I beg of you!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"It really is Potter, Really!\" \n\"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death \nEater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from \nXenophilius. \n\"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up \nthe mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might \nbring the place down.\" \n\"You lying piece of filth.\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \n\"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, \ndid you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\" \n\"I swear...I swear...Potter's upstairs!\" \n\"Homenum revelio.\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, \nand he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body \nin its shadow. \n\"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply. \n\"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please...please...give me Luna, \njust let me have Luna...\" \n\"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and \nbring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice \nwaiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to \nbury.\" \nXenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. \nXenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. \n\n\f\n\"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\" \nHe started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the \nstaircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they \ncould, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off \nhis legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione \nmanaged to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. \n\"All right.\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs \nbegin to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \n\"Do you trust me Harry?\" \nHarry nodded. \n\"Okay then.\" Hermione whispered. \"give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to \nput it on.\" \n\"Me? But Harry --\" \n\"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder.\" \nHarry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking \nthe stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry \ndid not know what Hermione was waiting for. \n\"Hold tight\" she whispered. \"Hold tight...any second...\" \nXenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. \n\"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath \nthem. \"Deprimo!\" \nShe had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still \nholding onto her hand for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two \nmen trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained \nall around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of \nthe collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Two \n\nThe Deathly Hallows \n\n \n\n Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have \nlanded in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around \nthem, waving her wand. \n\n \u201cProtego Totalum\u2026Salvio Hexia\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cThat treacherous old bleeder.\u201d Ron panted, emerging from beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \u201cHermione you\u2019re a genius, a total genius. I \ncan\u2019t believe we got out of that.\u201d \n\n \u201cCave Inimicum\u2026Didn\u2019t I say it was an Frumpent horn, didn\u2019t I tell him? And \nnow his house has been blown apart!\u201d \n\n \u201cServes him right,\u201d said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, \n\u201cWhat\u2019d you reckon they\u2019ll do to him?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh I hope they don\u2019t kill him!\u201d groaned Hermione, \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted the \nDeath Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn\u2019t \nbeen lying!\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWhy hide me though?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They\u2019ve kidnapped Luna \nbecause her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew \nyou\u2019re with him?\u201d \n\n \u201cBut what about your mum and dad?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re in Australia,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cThey should be all right. They don\u2019t \nknow anything.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Ron repeated, looking awed. \n\nYeah, you are,", "input_ids": [1, 5417, 29889, 1094, 278, 2211, 310, 963, 5148, 3448,

\nthat the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must \nnot tell lies. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?\u201d asked Ron angrily. \n\n\u201cOf course, Ron, but people are terrified,\u201d Mr. Weasley replied, \u201cterrified that \nthey will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty \nrumors going around; I for one don\u2019t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts \nresigned. She hasn\u2019t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in \nhis office all day; I just hope he\u2019s working on a plan.\u201d \n\nThere was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the \nwork surface and served apple tart. \n\n\u201cWe must decide \u2018ow you will be disguised, \u2018Arry,\u201d said Fleur, once everyone \nhad pudding. \u201cFor ze wedding,\u201d she added, when he looked confused. \u201cOf course, none \nof our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something \nslip after zey \u2018ave \u2018ad champagne.\u201d \n\nFrom this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. \n\n\u201cYes, good point,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, \nspectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had \nscribbled on a very long piece of parchment. \u201cNow, Ron, have you cleaned out your \nroom yet?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. \n\u201cWhy does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are holding your brother\u2019s wedding here in a few days\u2019 time, young man \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cAnd are they getting married in my bedroom?\u201d asked Ron furiously. \u201cNo! So \nwhy in the name of Merlin\u2019s saggy left \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to your mother like that,\u201d said Mr. Weasley firmly. \u201cAnd do as you\u2019re \ntold.\u201d \n\nRon scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last \nfew mouthfuls of his apple tart. \n\n\u201cI can help, some of it\u2019s my mess.\u201d Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across \nhim. \n\n\u201cNo, Harry, dear, I\u2019d much rather you helped Arthur much out the chickens, and \nHermione, I\u2019d be ever so grateful if you\u2019d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame \nDelacour; you know they\u2019re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.\u201d \n\nBut as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. \u201cThere\u2019s no need \nto, er, mention it to Molly,\u201d Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, \u201cbut, \ner, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius\u2019s bike and, er, I\u2019m hiding \u2013 that\u2019s \nto say, keeping \u2013 it in here. Fantastic stuff: There\u2019s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it\u2019s \ncalled, the most magnificent battery, and it\u2019ll be a great opportunity to find out how \nbrakes work. I\u2019m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly\u2019s not \u2013 I \nmean, when I\u2019ve got time.\u201d \n\nWhen they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry \nslipped upstairs to Ron\u2019s attic bedroom. \n\n\f\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m doing \u2013 ! Oh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the \nroom. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was \njust as messy as it had been all week; the only chance was that Hermione was now sitting \nin the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of \nwhich Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles. \n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. \n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to get away?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, Ron\u2019s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets \nyesterday,\u201d said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and \nThe Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. \n\n\u201cWe were just talking about Mad-Eye,\u201d Ron told Harry. \u201cI reckon he might have \nsurvived.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cYeah, but Bill was under attack too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow can he be sure what he \nsaw?\u201d \n\n\u201cEven if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,\u201d said \nHermione, now weight Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. \n\n\u201cHe could have used a Shield Charm \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cFleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cWell, all right, if you want him to be dead,\u201d said Ron grumpily, punching his \npillow into a more comfortable shape. \n\n\u201cOf course we don\u2019t want him to be dead!\u201d said Hermione, looking shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s \ndreadful that he\u2019s dead! But we\u2019re being realistic!\u201d \n\nFor the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye\u2019s body, broken as Dumbledore\u2019s had \nbeen, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed \nwith a bizarre desire to laugh. \n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that\u2019s why no one\u2019s found \nhim,\u201d said Ron wisely. \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in \nHagrid\u2019s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her \nburst into tears over her copy of Spellman\u2019s Syllabary. \n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. \u201cHermione, I \nwasn\u2019t trying to upset \u2013\u201c \n\nBut with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got \nthere first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a \nrevolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily \npulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, \u201cTergeo.\u201d \n\nThe wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, \nRon handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. \n\n\u201cOh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I\u2019m sorry. . . .\u201d She blew her nose and hiccupped. \u201cIt\u2019s \njust so awf-ful, isn\u2019t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye \ndying, somehow, he seemed so tough!\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ron, giving her a squeeze. \u201cBut you know what he\u2019d say to \nus if he was here?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2019C-constant vigilance,\u2019\u201d said Hermione, mopping her eyes. \n\n\f\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019d tell us to learn from what happened to \nhim. And what I\u2019ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.\u201d \n\nHermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A \nsecond later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped \nThe Monster of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt \nand snapped viciously at Ron\u2019s ankle. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Herm", "input_ids": [1, 278, 8760, 6677, 1497, 10686,

His hair was matted and his robes stained. \n\n \u201cKreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\u201d croaked the elf. \n\u201cFletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. \nNevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve done really well, Kreacher,\u201d said Harry, and the elf bowed low. \n\n \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got a few questions for you,\u201d Harry told Mundungus, who shouted \nat once. \n\n \u201cI panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never \nvolunteered to die for you, an\u2019 that was bleedin\u2019 You-Know-Who come flying at me, \nanyone woulda got outta there. I said all along I didn\u2019t wanna do it \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cFor your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\u201d said Hermione. \n\n \u201cWell, you\u2019re a bunch of bleedin\u2019 \u2018eroes then, aren\u2019t you, but I never pretended I \nwas up for killing meself \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\u201d said Harry, moving his \nwand a little closer to Mundungus\u2019s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \u201cWe already knew you were \nan unreliable bit of scum.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell then, why the \u2018ell am I being \u2018unted down by \u2018ouse-elves? Or is this about \nthem goblets again? I ain\u2019t got none of \u2018em left, or you could \u2018ave \u2018em \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not about the goblets either, although you\u2019re getting warmer,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cShut up and listen.\u201d \n\n It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand \nsome small portion of truth. Harry\u2019s wand was now so close to the bridge of \nMundungus\u2019s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. \n\n \u201cWhen you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\u201d Harry began, but \nMundungus interrupted him again. \n\n \u201cSirius never cared about any of the junk \u2013\u201d \n\n There was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, \nand a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head \nwith a saucepan. \n\n \u201cCall \u2018im off, call \u2018im off, \u2018e should be locked up!\u201d screamed Mundungus, \ncowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. \n\n \u201cKreacher, no!\u201d shouted Harry. \n\n Kreacher\u2019s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. \n\n \u201cPerhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\u201d \n\n Ron laughed. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the \nhonors,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cThank you very much, Master,\u201d said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a \nshort distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. \n\n \u201cWhen you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\u201d Harry began \nagain, \u201cyou took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\u201d \nHarry\u2019s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione\u2019s tension and \nexcitement too. \u201cWhat did you do with it?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Mundungus. \u201cIs it valuable?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve still got it!\u201d cried Hermione. \n\n \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron shrewdly. \u201cHe\u2019s wondering whether he should have \nasked more money for it.\u201d \n\n \u201cMore?\u201d said Mundungus. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been effing difficult . . .bleedin\u2019 \ngave it away, di\u2019n\u2019 I? No choice.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cI was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I\u2019ve got a \nlicense for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin\u2019 snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she \ntook a fancy to the locket an\u2019 told me she\u2019d take it and let me off that time, and to fink \nmeself lucky.\u201d \n\n \u201cWho was this woman?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cI dunno, some Ministry hag.\u201d \n\n Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. \n\n \u201cLittle woman. Bow on top of \u2018er head.\u201d \n\n He frowned and then added, \u201cLooked like a toad.\u201d \n\n Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into \nhis eyebrows, which ignited. \n\n \u201cAquamenti!\u201d screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, \nengulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. \n\n Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces. \nThe scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. \n\n \n\nChapter Twelve \n\nMagic is Might \n\n \n\n As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld \nPlace shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number \ntwelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve \nitself. The muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing \nmistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. \n\n And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the \nanomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in \nGrimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings \nfacing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The \nlurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike \n\n\f\nfor normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric \ndressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, \nwondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. \n\n The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. \nOccasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something \ninteresting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed. \n\n On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than \never before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at \nhouses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared \nelusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first \ntime in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to \nhave seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest \ncompanion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed \ninto their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed. \n\n Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly \nlost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought \nthat the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. \nShutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped \nit over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the \nbasement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. \n\n The usual low whisper of \u201cSeverus", "input_ids": [1, 29889, 940, 18318, 17786, 29871, 13, 1552, 19656, 29892, 21692, 278, 29181, 297,

No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.\n\u3000\u3000Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered her.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother's voice.\n\u3000\u3000It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving off,\" said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch. \"Check who's in there, Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione peered around the classroom door.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?\" Lupin asked, frowning slightly.\n\u3000\u3000The babble broke out again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- two rolls of parchment!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the essay.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \"I've already finished it!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless looking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lures travelers into bogs,\" said Professor Lupin as they took notes. \"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people follow the light -- then --\"\n\u3000\u3000The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.\n\u3000\u3000When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but --\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I'd like a word.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's box with a cloth.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I'm sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you hear about the dementors too?\" said Harry with difficulty.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked at him quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the reason you fell?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself.\" Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It has nothing to do with weakness,\" said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. \"The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have.\"\n\u3000\u3000A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When they get near me --\" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat tight. \"I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Why did they have to come to the match?\" said Harry bitterly.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're getting hungry,\" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. \"Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions running high... it was their idea of a feast.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Azkaban must be terrible,\" Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Sirius Black escaped from them,\" Harry said slowly. \"He got away...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" he said, straightening up, \"Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You made that dementor on the train back off,\" said Harry suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There are -- certain defenses one can use,\" said Lupin. \"But there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What defenses?\" said Harry at once. \"Can you teach me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the contrary...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said, \"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holid", "input_ids": [1, 11710, 29892, 541, 694, 697, 1683, 784, 23384, 1432, 931, 896, 3512, 2978, 697, 29889, 1939, 697, 1683, 6091, 2916, 267, 297, 1009, 2343, 310,

the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face, Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.\n\u3000\u3000THE END \n\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \nBy J. K. Rowling \n\n\f\n Chapter One \nThe Dark Lord Ascending \n\n\nThe two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit \nlane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, \nrecognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking \nbriskly in the same direction. \n\"News?\" asked the taller of the two. \n\"The best,\" replied Severus Snape. \nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, \nneatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they \nmarched. \n\"Thought I might be late,\" said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as \nthe branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \"It was a little trickier than I \nexpected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be \ngood?\" \nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led \noff the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the \npair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the men\u2019s way. Neither of them broke step: \nIn silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as \nthough the dark metal was smoke. \n\n The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men\u2019s footsteps. There was a rustle \nsomewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion\u2019s \nhead, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, \nstrutting majestically along the top of the hedge. \n\n \u201cHe always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks \u2026\u201d Yaxley thrust his wand back \nunder his cloak with a snort. \n\n A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, \nlights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden \nbeyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and \nYaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though \nnobody had visibly opened it. \n\n The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent \ncarpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall \nfollowed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden \ndoor leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned \nthe bronze handle. \n\n The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The \nroom\u2019s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination \ncame from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded \nmirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew \naccustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the \nscene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, \nrevolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in \nthe bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this \n\n\f\nsingular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below \nit. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so. \n\n \u201cYaxley. Snape,\u201d said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \u201cYou are \nvery nearly late.\u201d \n\n The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at \nfirst, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, \nhowever, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and \ngleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a \npearly glow. \n\n \u201cSeverus, here,\u201d said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \n\u201cYaxley \u2013 beside Dolohov.\u201d \n\n The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table \nfollowed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first. \n\n \u201cSo?\u201d \n\n \u201cMy Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current \nplace of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\u201d \n\n The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, \nall gazing at Snape and Voldemort. \n\n \u201cSaturday \u2026 at nightfall,\u201d repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon \nSnape\u2019s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently \nfearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, \nhowever, looked calmly back into Voldemort\u2019s face and, after a moment or two, \nVoldemort\u2019s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. \n\n \u201cGood. Very good. And this information comes \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c \u2013 from the source we discussed,\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cMy Lord.\u201d \n\n Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. \nAll faces turned to him. \n\n \u201cMy Lord, I have heard differently.\u201d \n\n Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \u201cDawlish, the Auror, \nlet slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns \nseventeen.\u201d \n\n Snape was smiling. \n\n \u201cMy source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No \ndoubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; \nhe is known to be susceptible.\u201d \n\n \u201cI assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\u201d said Yaxley. \n\n \u201cIf he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI assure you, \nYaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The \nOrder believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe Order\u2019s got one thing right, then, eh?\u201d said a squat man sitting a short \ndistance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the \ntable. \n\n Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving \nslowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. \n\n\f\n \u201cMy Lord,\u201d Yaxley went on, \u201cDawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be \nused to transfer the boy \u2013\u201c \n\n Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching \nresentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape. \n\n \u201cWhere are they going to hide the boy next?\u201d \n\n \u201cAt the home of one of the Order,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe place, according to the \nsource, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could \nprovide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, \nof course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the \nopportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, Yaxley?\u201d Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely \nin his", "input_ids": [1, 9796,

rubies the size of eggs.\n\u3000\u3000\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous -\n\u3000\u3000It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the sword in both his hands -\n\u3000\u3000The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth -\n\u3000\u3000But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\n\u3000\u3000A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\"\n\u3000\u30001,520\n\u3000\u3000He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him.\n\u3000\u3000He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's voice above him. \"Dead. Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter? He's crying.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad.\n\u3000\u3000Even the pain was leaving him ....\n\u3000\u3000But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle's voice suddenly. \"Get away from him - I said, get away --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. \"Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked into Harry's face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....\n\u3000\u3000He raised the wand\n\u3000\u3000Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\n\u3000\u3000There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then\n\u3000\u3000He had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.\n\u3000\u3000Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.\n\u3000\u3000Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused\n\u3000\u30001,522\n\u3000\u3000eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I d- diddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I r- remember is him coming out of the diary --\"\n\u3000\u3000\" It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\n\u3000\u3000After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny's okay! I've got her!\"\n\u3000\u3000He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull\n\u3000\u3000321,3\n\u3000\u3000her through first. \"You're alive! I don't believe it! What happened?\" How - what -- where did that bird come from?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's Dumbledore's,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself\n\u3000\u3000\"How come you've got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry's hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"But --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn't think it was a good idea to tell", "input_ids": [1, 29929, 13, 30358, 30358, 29909, 27003, 11500, 13283, 22378, 750, 7470, 2768, 278, 3056, 29892, 967, 4386, 3144, 5171, 292, 411, 14051,

-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you've been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Mum -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to bed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car -\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I've never seen a de-gnoming -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\"\n\u3000\u3000And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron\n\u3000\u3000they crossed the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome.\n\u3000\u3000It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes.\"\n\u3000\u3000He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until\n\u3000\u3000\"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ......\n\u3000\u3000The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\n\u3000\u3000\"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put.\"\n\u3000\u3000Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Just then, the front door slammed.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's back!\" said George. \"Dad's home!\"\n\u3000\u3000They hurried through the garden and back into the house.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\n\u3000\u3000\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it .... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\n\u3000\u3000\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\"\n", "input_ids": [1, 29892, 306, 29915,

\nbehind the headmaster\u2019s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the \ncabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape\u2019s \nmemories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into \nsomeone else\u2019s head would be a blessed relief\u2026 Nothing that even Snape had left him \ncould be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, \n\n\f\nand without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would \nassuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. \n\n He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he \nstraightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge \nchimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, \nand a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was \noverlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a \nshabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. \n\n Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, \nsallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the \nyounger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. \n\n \u201cLily, don\u2019t do it!\u201d shrieked the elder of the two. \n\n But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the \nair, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and \ninstead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through \nthe air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. \n\n \u201cMummy told you not to!\u201d \n\n Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, \nmaking a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. \n\n \u201cMummy said you weren\u2019t allowed, Lily!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Lily, still giggling. \u201cTuney, look at this. Watch what I can \ndo.\u201d \n\n Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, \nthough the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush \nbehind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and \ndisapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held \nout her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, \nmany-lipped oyster. \n\n \u201cStop it!\u201d shrieked Petunia. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not hurting you,\u201d said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and \nthrew it back to the ground. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower\u2019s flight to the \nground and lingered upon it. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she added, and there was definite \nlonging in her voice. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped \nout from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but \nLily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his \nappearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s obvious?\u201d asked Lily. \n\n Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now \nhovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cI know what you are.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re a witch,\u201d whispered Snape. \n\n She looked affronted. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\u201d \n\n She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. \n\n\f\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did \nnot take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the \nsmock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. \n\n The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the \nswing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag. \n\n \u201cYou are,\u201d said Snape to Lily. \u201cYou are a witch. I\u2019ve been watching you for a \nwhile. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My mum\u2019s one, and I\u2019m a wizard.\u201d \n\n Petunia\u2019s laugh was like cold water. \n\n \u201cWizard!\u201d she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from \nthe shock of his unexpected appearance. \u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re that Snape boy! \nThey live down Spinner\u2019s End by the river,\u201d she told Lily, and it was evident from her \ntone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. \u201cWhy have you been spying \non us?\u201d \n\n \u201cHaven\u2019t been spying,\u201d said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the \nbright sunlight. \u201cWouldn\u2019t spy on you, anyway,\u201d he added spitefully, \u201cyou\u2019re a Muggle.\u201d \n\n Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake \nthe tone. \n\n \u201cLily, come on, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, \nglaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the \nplayground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape\u2019s bitter \ndisappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, \nand that it had all gone wrong\u2026 \n\n The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was \nnow in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. \nThe shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing \neach other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock \nlooked less pecular in the half light. \n\n \u201c\u2026and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get \nletters.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I have done magic outside school!\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re all right. We haven\u2019t got wands yet. They let you off when you\u2019re a kid \nand you can\u2019t help it. But once you\u2019re eleven,\u201d he nodded importantly, \u201cand they start \ntraining you, then you\u2019ve got to go careful.\u201d \n\n There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, \nand Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, \nleaned in toward the boy, and said, \u201cIt is real, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not a joke? Petunia says you\u2019re \nlying to me. Petunia says there isn\u2019t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s real for us,\u201d said Snape. \u201cNot for her. But we\u2019ll get the letter, you and me.\u201d \n\n \u201cReally?\u201d whispered Lily. \n\n \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he \nstruck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his \ndestiny. \n\n \u201cAnd will it really come by owl?\u201d Lily whispered. \n\n \u201cNormally,\u201d said Snape. \u201cBut you\u2019re Muggle-born, so someone from the school \nwill have to come and explain to your parents.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoes it make a difference, being Muggle-", "input_ids": [1, 3515, 29892,

on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re \nmoving you tonight. We\u2019ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you\u2019re not \nleaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we\u2019re dealing with, so we \ncan\u2019t rely on him getting the date wrong; he\u2019s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters \npatrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we\u2019ve given a dozen different \nhouses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place \nwe\u2019re going to hide you, they\u2019ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, \nKingsley\u2019s place, Molly\u2019s Auntie Muriel\u2019s \u2013 you get the idea.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping \nhole in the plan. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ll be going to Tonks\u2019s parents. Once you\u2019re within the boundaries of the \nprotective enchantments we\u2019ve put on their house you\u2019ll be able to use a Portkey to the \nBurrow. Any questions?\u201d \n\n \u201cEr \u2013 yes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t know which of the twelve secure \nhouses I\u2019m heading for at first, but won\u2019t it be sort of obvious once\u201d \u2013 he performed a \nquick headcount \u2013 \u201cfourteen of us fly off toward Tonks\u2019s parents?\u201d \n\n \u201cAh,\u201d said Moody, \u201cI forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won\u2019t be \nflying to Tonks\u2019s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies \ntonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\u201d \n\n From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. \nThere was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan \nimmediately. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. \u201cNo way!\u201d \n\n \u201cI told them you\u2019d take it like this,\u201d said Hermione with a hint of complacency. \n\n \u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to let six people risk their lives -- !\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014because it\u2019s the first time for all of us,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cThis is different, pretending to be me \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWell, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\u201d said Fred earnestly. \u201cImagine if \nsomething went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\u201d \n\n Harry did not smile. \n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t do it if I don\u2019t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s the plan scuppered,\u201d said George. \u201cObviously there\u2019s no chance at \nall of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who\u2019s not allowed to use magic; we\u2019ve \ngot no chance,\u201d said Fred. \n\n \u201cFunny,\u201d said Harry, \u201creally amusing.\u201d \n\n \u201cIf it has to come to force, then it will,\u201d growled Moody, his magical eye now \nquivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. \u201cEveryone here\u2019s overage, Potter, and \nthey\u2019re all prepared to take the risk.\u201d \n\n Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance \nat him out of the side of Moody\u2019s head. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s have no more arguments. Time\u2019s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, \nboy, now.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut this is mad, there\u2019s no need \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cNo need!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cWith You-Know-Who out there and half the \nMinistry on his side? Potter, if we\u2019re lucky he\u2019ll have swallowed the fake bait and he\u2019ll \n\n\f\nbe planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he\u2019d be mad not to have a Death Eater or \ntwo keeping an eye out, it\u2019s what I\u2019d do. They might not be able to get at you or this \nhouse while your mother\u2019s charm holds, but it\u2019s about to break and they know the rough \nposition of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can\u2019t split \nhimself into seven.\u201d \n\n Harry caught Hermione\u2019s eye and looked away at once. \n\n \u201cSo, Potter \u2013 some of your hair, if you please.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way. \n\n \u201cNow!\u201d barked Moody. \n\n With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed \na hank of hair, and pulled. \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of \npotion. \u201cStraight in here, if you please.\u201d \n\n Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with \nits surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright \ngold. \n\n \u201cOoh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, \nbefore catching sight of Ron\u2019s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \u201cOh, you \nknow what I mean \u2013 Goyle\u2019s potion tasted like bogies.\u201d \n\n \u201cRight then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\u201d said Moody. \n\n Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia\u2019s \ngleaming sink. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re one short,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n \u201cHere,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck \nand dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along \nto stand between Fred and George instead. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m a soldier, I\u2019d sooner be a protector,\u201d said Mundungus. \n\n \u201cShut it,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cAs I\u2019ve already told you, you spineless worm, any \nDeath Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore \nalways said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It\u2019ll be the protectors \nwho have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters\u2019ll want to kill them.\u201d \n\n Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling \nhalf a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before \npouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \n\n \u201cAltogether, then \u2026 \u201c \n\n Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped \nand grimaced as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and \ndistort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and \nGeorge were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione\u2019s and Fleur\u2019s appearing to \nshoot backward into their skulls. \n\n Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had \nbrought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping \nand panting in front of him. \n\n Fred and George turned to each other and said together, \u201cWow \u2013 we\u2019re identical!\u201d \n\n \u201cI dunno, though, I think I\u2019m still better-looking,\u201d said Fred, examining his \nreflection in the kettle. \n\n\f\n \u201cBah,\u201d said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, \u201cBill, don\u2019t look at me \n\u2013 I\u2019m \u2018ideous.\u201d \n\n \u201cThose whose clothes are a bit roomy, I\u2019ve got smaller here,\u201d said Moody, \nindicating the first sack, \u201cand vice versa. Don\u2019t forget the glasses, there\u2019s six pairs in the \n", "input_ids": [1, 13, 13, 15, 13, 1346, 1576, 697, 2655, 591, 30010, 345, 2355, 373, 1749, 2625, 338, 393, 887, 29899, 29968, 3707,

But you were now accompanied by somebody else.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry. \"No, we weren't!\"\n\u3000\u3000I couldn't believe my eyes,\" said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry's interruption. \"I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?\" \"No one was with us!\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black.... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"One of us!\" Ron said angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Two of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?\" he said evenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron. \"What's Scabbers got to do with it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Everything,\" said Lupin. \"Could I see him, please?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing noise.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What's my rat got to do with anything?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, he's not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He's a wizard.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\u3000\u3000MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS\n\u3000\u3000It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're both mental.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me... not this time, though!\"\n\u3000\u3000And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.\n\u3000\u3000.\"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we've got to explain --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape.\n\u3000\u3000\"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\"\n\u3000\u3000He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?\n\u3000\u3000Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.\n\u3000\u3000\"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be true, you know it can't...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, I only know how it began...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one there...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\"\n\u3000\u3000He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then said, \"That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf, None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I hadn't been so foolhardy...\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\n\u3000\u3000\"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform....

he asked the gargoyle. \n\n \u201cFeel free,\u201d groaned the statue. \n\n They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly \nupward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. \n\n He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, \nand then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death \nEaters and the rebirth of Voldemort --- \n\n But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of \nHogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases \ntheir wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other\u2019s hands; they danced up \nand down on their chairs in which they have been painted: Dilys Derwent sobbed \nunashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, \n\n\f\nin his high, reedy voice, \u201cAnd let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our \ncontribution not be forgotten!\u201d \n\n But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly \nbehind the headmaster\u2019s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon \nspectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him \nfilled Harry wit h the same balm as phoenix song. \n\n At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming \nand mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at \nDumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed \nthough he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. \n\n \u201cThe thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\u201d he began, \u201cI dropped it in the forest. I \ndon\u2019t exactly here, but I\u2019m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\u201d \n\n \u201cMy dear boy, I do,\u201d said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused \nand curious. \u201cA wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of \nyou. Does anyone know else know where it fell?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo one,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m going to keep Ignotus\u2019s present, though,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore \nbeamed. \n\n \u201cBut of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this.\u201d \n\n Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a \nreverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cAre you mental?\u201d \n\n \u201cI know it\u2019s powerful,\u201d said Harry wearily. \u201cBut I was happier with mine. So . . .\u201d \n\n He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves \nof holly tstill just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said \nthat they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if \nthis did not work, nothing would. \n\n He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster\u2019s desk, touched it with the very tip \nof the Elder Wand, and said, \u201cReparo.\u201d \n\n As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had \nsucceeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his \nfingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m putting the Elder Wand,\u201d he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with \nenormous affection and admiration, \u201cback where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a \nnatural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won\u2019t it? The previous master will \nnever have been defeated. That\u2019ll be the end of it. \n\n Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other. \n\n \u201cAre you sure?\u201d said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as \nhe looked at the Elder Wand. \n\n \u201cI think Harry\u2019s right,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \n\n \u201cThat wand\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd quite honestly,\u201d he \nturned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying \nwaiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a \nsandwich there, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\u201d \n\n\f\n \n\nEpilogue \n\nNineteen Years Later \n\n \n\n \n\nAutumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was \ncrisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the \ngreat sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like \ncobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents \nwere pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed \nfearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \n\n \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \n\n \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" \n\n The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the \nbarrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the \nsurrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \n\n \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \n\n \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \n\n \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's \nnothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" \n\n But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the \nbarrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took \nthe trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \n\n \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, \ncapitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \n\n \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \n\n \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters \nfrom home about once a month.\" \n\n \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \n\n \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry \nput in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" \n\n Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they \nreached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged \nonto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was \npouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the \nmist, into which James had already disappeared. \n\n \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed \nas they made their way down the platform. \n\n \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. \n\n But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. \nDetached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head \nPercy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not \n", "input_ids": [1, 17786, 29936, 372, 8389, 301, 3554,

He did not want to look away from her. \n\"What is it?\" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what \nlooked and smelled like dirty laundry. \n\"There,\" she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. \nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, \na ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn \nand horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring \nfrom the place where her neck had been. \nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand \nspinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was \nextinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of \nhim: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing -- \nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the \ntable where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him \nas he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, \"Harry?\" \n\n\n\f\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass \nsmashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular -- \n\"No!\" he gasped, pinned to the floor. \n\"Yes,\" whispered the voice. \"Yesss... hold you ... hold you ...\" \n\"Accio ... Accio Wand ...\" \nBut nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it \ncoiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into \nhis chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his \nbrain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, \ndistant footsteps, everything going... \nA metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph \nin his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... \nHe was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He \nscrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and \nHermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which \nshattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken \nglass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something -- his wand -- \nHe bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; \nHermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then \nthere was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking \nHarry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry \nraised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it \nhad done in years. \n\"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!\" \nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves \nfrom the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and \nseized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione -- \nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but \nHarry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his \nhead was going to split open with the pain from his scar -- \nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, \nHermione screamed, \"Confringo!\" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the \nwardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt \nthe heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, \nhe leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window \n\n\f\ninto nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... \nAnd then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid \nbedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man \nand the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled \nwith the girl's, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in \nChristmas Day... \nAnd his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, \nwhere it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so \nclose to knowing what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his \nbody ... But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold \nhe feel so unbearably, didn't pain cease with death, didn't it go ... \nThe night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square \nand the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a \nworld in which they did not believe ... And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose \nand power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions ... Not anger ... \nthat was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph, yes ... He had waited for this, he had \nhoped for it ... \n\"Nice costume, mister!\" \nHe saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the \ncloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath \nthe robe he fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would \nnever reach his mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary ... \nAnd along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, \nthe Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise \nthan the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, \nand steered over it ... \nThey had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the \ntall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand \nfor the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was \nlaughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... \nA door opened and the mother entered, saying words he cold not hear, her long dark-red \nhair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the \nmother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... \nThe gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white \nhand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... \nHe was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he \n\n\f\nhad not even picked up his wand ... \n\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!\" \nHold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... \n\"Avada Kedavra!\" \nThe green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it \nmade the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose \nstrings were cut ... \nHe could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was \nsensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear ... He climbed the steps, listening with faint \namusement to her attempts", "input_ids": [1, 29889, 940, 1258, 451, 864, 304, 1106, 3448, 515, 902, 29889, 29871, 13, 29908, 5618, 338, 372, 3026, 540,

Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry\n\u3000\u3000*141*\n\u3000\u3000couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\" said Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story's in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......\n\u3000\u3000The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net.\n\u3000\u3000At last Dumbledore straightened up.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's not dead, Argus,\" he said softly.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. \"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" said Lockhart). \"But how, I cannot say . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You saw what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a - I'm a -\" Filch's face worked horribly. \"He knows I'm a Squib!\" he finished.\n\u3000\u3000142\n\u3000\u3000\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \"And I don't even know what a Squib is.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were there -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. \"I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.\n\u3000\u3000Snape's nasty smile widened.\n\u3000\u3000*143*\n\u3000\u3000\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he said. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light- blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly.\n\u3000\u3000Snape looked furious. So did Filch.\n\u3000\u3000\"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to see some punishment!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a very awkward pause.\n\u3000\u3000\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into\n\u3000\u3000*144*\n\u3000\u3000an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends' darkened faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\"\n\u3000\u3000Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it's weird ......\n\u3000\u3000\"I know it's weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing's weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened... What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've been Bill . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers.

silently toward the door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the\n\u3000\u300049\n\u3000\u3000very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.\n\u3000\u3000The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\"\n\u3000\u300050\n\u3000\u3000A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call ......\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy's lip curled.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that flea- bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a hot surge of anger.\n\u3000\u3000\"- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion.\n\u3000\u300051\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy's list and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No offense, sir, no offense meant -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Though if his grades don't pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\n\u3000\u3000\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy shortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today -\"\n\u3000\u3000They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.\n\u3000\u3000* 52\n\u3000\u3000Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle\n\u3000\u3000\"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\"\n\u3000\u3000The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ......\n\u3000\u3000Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.\n\u3000\u3000Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here.\n\u3000\u3000An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes\n\u3000\u3000back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\n\u3000\u3000An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I'm just -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HARRY!

out from behind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.\n\u3000\u3000It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes swishing, then stopped in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000There was a look of surpressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly hid in his pockets.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come with me, Potter,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley -- apparently alone.\"\n\u3000\u3000Still, Harry didn't speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to look mildly surprised.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know, Professor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a long silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,\" said Harry. \"If he's seeing things like --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\" said Snape softly. \"Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that,\" said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. \"It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy is not having hallucinations,\" snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. \"If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,\" said Harry. \"Like you told --\" \"Can anyone confirm that?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said, straightening up again. \"Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.\n\u3000\u3000\"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\" Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. \"He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dad didn't strut,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"And neither do I.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your father didn't set much store by rules either,\" Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \"Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SHUT UP!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care that Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you say to me, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told you to shut up about my dad!\" Harry yelled. I know the truth, all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for my dad!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\n\u3000\u3000\"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?\" he whispered. \"Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.\n\u3000\u3000I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter,\" he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. \"Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Turn out your pockets, Potter!\" he spat suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and the Marauder's Map.\n\u3000\u3000Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron gave them to me,\" said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. \"He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last time --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very touching... and what is this?\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spare bit of parchment,\" he said with a shrug.\n\u3000\u3000Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?\" he said. \"Why don't I just -- throw this away?\"\n\u3000\u3000His hand moved toward the fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" Harry said quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"So!\" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. \"Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me see, let me see....\" he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. \"Reveal your secret!\" he said, touching the wand to the parchment.\n\u3000\u3000Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Show yourself!\" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.\n\u3000\u3000It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!\" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.\n\u3000\u3000As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.\n\u3000\u3000Mooney presents his compliments", "input_ids": [1, 3654, 714, 29936,

clutched in her hand. It was * The Life and Lies \nof Albus Dumbledore.* \n\"What?\" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a \nchapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita's \nversion of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione's answer however, was \ncompletely unexpected. \n\"I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.\" \nHe stared at her. \n\"Sorry?\" \n\n \n\n\u201cXenophilius Lovegood, Luna\u2019s father. I want to go and talk to him!\u201d \n\n\u201cer \u2013 why?\u201d \n\nShe took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s that mark, the \nmark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!\u201d \n\nShe thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry\u2019s unwilling eyes \nand saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, \nwith Dumbledore\u2019s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof \nthat Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita\u2019s invention. \n\n\u201cThe signature,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cLook at the signature, Harry!\u201d \n\nHe obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking \nmore closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of \nAlbus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle \nthe Bard. \n\n\u201cEr \u2013 what are you -- ?\u201d said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a \nlook and turned back to Harry. \n\n\u201cIt keeps cropping up, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cI know Viktor said it was \nGrindelwald\u2019s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and the \n\n\f\ndates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, \nwe can\u2019t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means \u2013 I don\u2019t even know whether \nGrindelwald\u2019s still alive \u2013 but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at \nthe wedding. I\u2019m sure this is important, Harry!\u201d \n\nHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and \nthen out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, \u201cHermione, \nwe don\u2019t need another Godric\u2019s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cBut it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, \nhow do you know we\u2019re not supposed to find out about the sign?\u201d \n\n \u201cHere we go again!\u201d Harry felt slightly exasperated. \u201cWe keep trying to convince \nourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cThe Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,\u201d piped up Ron. \u201cI think \nHermione\u2019s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.\u201d \n\n Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron\u2019s support of Hermione \nhad little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. \n\n \u201cIt won\u2019t be like Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d Ron added, \u201cLovegood\u2019s on your side, Harry, \nThe Quibbler\u2019s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they\u2019ve got to help you!\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure this is important!\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \n\n \u201cBut don\u2019t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he \ndied?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaybe . . . maybe it\u2019s something you need to find out for yourself,\u201d said \nHermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron sycophantically, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d snapped Hermione, \u201cbut I still think we ought to talk to Mr. \nLovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric\u2019s Hollow? Harry, \nI\u2019m sure we ought to know about this!\u201d \n\n \u201cI think we should vote on it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThose in favor of going to see Love \ngood \u2013\u201d \n\n His hand flew into the air before Hermione\u2019s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as \nshe raised her own. \n\n \u201cOutvoted, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Ron, clapping him on the back. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d said Harry, half amused, half irritated. \u201cOnly, once we\u2019ve seen Lovegood, \nlet\u2019s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood\u2019s live, \nanyway? Do either of you know? \n\n \u201cYeah, they\u2019re not far from my place,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI dunno exactly where, but \nMum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn\u2019t be \nhard to find.\u201d \n\n When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. \n\n \u201cYou only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\u201d \n\n \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d said Ron brightly, \u201cand this is a bit of both. Cheer up, \nit\u2019s the Christmas holidays, Luna\u2019ll be home!\u201d \n\n They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the \nbreezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point \nthe village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight \nstretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking \ntoward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were \n\n\f\nthe high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house \nprotection from Muggle eyes. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,\u201d \nsaid Hermione coldly. \n\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the Burrow!\u201d said Ron with an incredulous laugh. \u201cDo you think I \nwas going to go back there and tell them all I\u2019d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and \nGeorge would\u2019ve been great about it. And Ginny, she\u2019d have been really understanding.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut where have you been, then?\u201d asked Hermione, surprised. \n\n \u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s new place. Shell cottage. Bill\u2019s always been decent to me. He \u2013 \nhe wasn\u2019t impressed when he heard what I\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t go on about it. He knew \nI was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and \nFleur weren\u2019t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You \nknow, first holiday after they were married. I don\u2019t think Fleur minded. You know how \nmuch she hates Celestina Warbeck.\u201d \n\n Ron turned his back on the Burrow. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s try up here,\u201d he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. \n\n They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione\u2019s insistence, hidden beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one \nsmall cottage, which seemed deserted. \n\n \u201cDo you think it\u2019s theirs, and they\u2019ve gone away for Christmas?\u201d said Hermione, \npeering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. \nRon snorted. \n\n \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got a feeling you\u2019d be able to tell who lived there if you looked \nthrough the Lovegoods\u2019 window. Let\u2019s try the next lot of hills.\u201d \n\n So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. \n\n \u201cAha!\u201d shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was \npointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared", "input_ids": [1, 1183, 1497, 29889, 29871, 13, 3868, 5148, 472, 278, 3143, 1603, 1067, 10519, 287, 297, 902, 1361,

that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. \n\n\f\n A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last \ncarriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn \nright up to them. \n\n \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. \n\n Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \n\n \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could \npass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \n\n \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \n\n \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together \nthey lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, \nand let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" \n\n Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having \nan animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally \nwent to Hogwarts. \n\n \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \n\n \"Ron!\" \n\n Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \n\n \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying \nattention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The \nsteam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the \nshifting mist. \n\n \"Look who it is.\" \n\n Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up \nto his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The \nnew boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of \nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \n\n \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in \nevery test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \n\n \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to \nturn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \n\n \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get \ntoo friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you \nmarried a pureblood.\" \n\n \"Hey!\" \n\n James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and \nwas evidently bursting with news. \n\n \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into \nthe billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging \nVictoire!\" \n\n He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \n\n \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy \nwhat he was doing --\" \n\n \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \n\n \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's \nsnogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \n\n\f\n \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy \nwould really be part of the family then!\" \n\n \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why \ndon't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \n\n \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could \nhave my room!\" \n\n \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the \nhouse demolished.\" \n\n He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \n\n \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \n\n \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \n\n \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \n\n \"But you know Neville--\" \n\n James rolled his eyes. \n\n \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into \nHerbology and give him love. . . .\" \n\n Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a \nkick at Albus. \n\n \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \n\n \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" \n\n but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a \nfleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint \naway up the corridor to find his friends. \n\n \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, \nthere's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the \ncarriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" \n\n Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \n\n \"See you at Christmas.\" \n\n \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to \ntea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And \ndon't let James wind you up.\" \n\n \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" \n\n The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of \ndeparture could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. \n\n Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of \nHarry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \n\n \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she \nwas tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were \nnamed for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was \nprobably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \n\n \"But just say--\" \n\n \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't \nmatter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. \nThe Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \n\n \"Really?\" \n\n \"It did for me,\" said Harry. \n\n\f\n He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in \nAlbus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, \nand the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute \nreminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. \nStudents were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on \nthe train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \n\n \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look \nat the other students. \n\n \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" \n\n Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked \nalongside it, watching his son's thin", "input_ids": [1, 517, 5040, 322, 1827, 22172, 29889, 869, 869, 869, 29871, 13, 13, 376, 29902, 1348, 393, 29915,

usually did, one of \nthe sides of their frames, but along what seemed to \n\nbe a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally \nshe was swallowed by the darkness. \n\n \"Er - what - ?\" began Ron. \n\n \"There's only one way in now,\" said Aberforth. \"You must know they've got all \nthe old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors \n\nall around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell \nme. The place has never been so heavily guarded. \n\nHow you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the \nCarrows as his deputies. . . well, that's your lookout, isn't it? \n\nYou say you're prepared to die.\" \n\n \"But what . . . ?\" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. \n\n A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was \nwalking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger \n\nas she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, \nwho was limping along, looking excited. His hair was \n\n\f\nlonger than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures \ngrew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. \n\nThen the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a \nreal tunnel was revealed. And our of it, his hair overgrown, \n\nhis face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of \ndelight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. \n\n\"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!\" \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Nine \n\nThe Lost Diadem \n\n\u201cNeville -- what the -- how -- ?\u201d \n\n But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging \nthem too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes \nwas swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of \nunkemptness suggested that he had been living enough. Nevertheless, his battered visage \nshone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come! Kept \ntelling Seamus it was a matter of time!\u201d \n\n \u201cNeville, what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat? This?\u201d Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. \u201cThis is \nnothing, Seamus is worse. You\u2019ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,\u201d he turned to \nAberforth, \u201cAb, there might be a couple more people no the way.\u201d \n\n \u201cCouple more?\u201d repeated Aberforth ominously. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, a couple \nmore, Longbottom? There\u2019s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know, that\u2019s why they\u2019ll be Apparating directly into the bar,\u201d said Neville. \n\u201cJust send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.\u201d \n\n Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the \nmantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you. You\u2019ve saved our lives twice.\u201d \n\n \u201cLook after \u2018em, then,\u201d said Aberforth gruffly. \u201cI might not be able to save \u2018em a \nthird time.\u201d \n\n Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana\u2019s \nportrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as though the \npassageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy \nfloor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the \nwall. \n\n \u201cHow long\u2019s this been here?\u201d Ron asked as they set off. \u201cIt isn\u2019t on the \nMarauder\u2019s Map, is it Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of \nschool?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey sealed off all of those before the start of the year,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThere\u2019s \nno chance of getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and \nDeath Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.\u201d He started walking backward, beaming, \ndrinking them in. \u201cNever mind that stuff \u2026 Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did \nyou escape on a dragon? It\u2019s everywhere, everyone\u2019s talking about it, Terry Boot got \nbeaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true,\u201d said Harry. \n\n Neville laughed gleefully. \n\n \u201cWhat did you do with the dragon?\u201d \n\n \u201cReleased it into the wild,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHermione was all for keeping it as a pet\u201c \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate, Ron \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut what have you been doing? People have been saying you\u2019ve just been on the \nrun, Harry, but I don\u2019t think so. I think you\u2019ve been up to something.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven\u2019t heard \nanything.\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s been \u2026. Well, it\u2019s not really like Hogwarts anymore,\u201d said Neville, the smile \nfading from his face as he spoke. \u201cDo you know about the Carrows?\u201d \n\n \u201cThose two Death Eaters who teach here?\u201d \n\n \u201cThey do more than teach,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThey\u2019re in charge of all discipline. \nThey like punishment, the Carrows.\u201d \n\n \u201cLike Umbridge?\u201d \n\n \u201cNah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to \nthe Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don\u2019t, though, if they can avoid it. You can \ntell they all hate them as much as we do.\u201d \n\n \u201cAmycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, \nexcept now it\u2019s just the Dark Arts. We\u2019re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on \npeople who\u2019ve earned detentions \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione\u2019s united voices echoed up and down the passage. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got this one,\u201d he pointed at a particularly \ndeep gash in his cheek, \u201cI refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and \nGoyle love it. First time they\u2019ve ever been top in anything, I expect.\u201d \n\n \u201cAlecto, Amycus\u2019s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for \neveryone. We\u2019ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and \ndirty, and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the \nnatural order is being reestablished. I got this one,\u201d he indicated another slash to his face, \n\u201cfor asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.\u201d \n\n \u201cBlimey, Neville,\u201d said Ron, \u201cthere\u2019s a time and a place for getting a smart \nmouth.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t see her,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have stood it either. The thing \nis, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that \nwhen you did it, Harry.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut they\u2019ve used you as a knife sharpener,\u201d said Ron, winding slightly as they \npassed a lamp and Neville\u2019s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. \n\n Neville shrugged. \n\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t want to spill too much pure blood, so they\u2019ll torture \nus a bit if we\u2019re mouthy but they won\u2019t actually kill us.\u201d \n\n Harry did not know what was worse, the

Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting \nlike a Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby\u2019s grave \nor not. He gathered himself for the attack. \n\n \u201cGriphook, I need to ask \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cYou also rescued a goblin.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou brought me here. Saved me.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, I take it you\u2019re not sorry?\u201d said Harry a little impatiently. \n\n \u201cNo, Harry Potter,\u201d said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black \nbeard upon his chin, \u201cbut you are a very odd wizard.\u201d \n\n \u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to \nme.\u201d \n\n The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as \nthough he had never seen anything like him. \n\n \u201cI need to break into a Gringotts vault.\u201d \n\n Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced from him as pain \nshot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his \nmind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at \nHarry as though he had gone mad. \n\n \u201cHarry \u2013\u201d said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. \n\n \u201cBreak into a Gringotts vault?\u201d repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted \nhis position upon the bed. \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ron contradicted him. \u201cIt\u2019s been done.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven \nyears ago.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe vault in question was empty at the time,\u201d snapped the goblin, and Harry \nunderstood that even though Griphook had let Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of \nits defenses being breached. \u201cIts protection was minimal.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, the vault we need to get into isn\u2019t empty, and I\u2019m guessing its protection \nwill be pretty powerful,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt belongs to the Lestranges.\u201d \n\n He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time \nenough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. \n\n \u201cYou have no chance,\u201d said Griphook flatly. \u201cNo chance at all. If you seek \nbeneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cThief, you have been warned, beware \u2013 yeah, I know, I remember,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to get myself any treasure, I\u2019m not trying to take anything for \npersonal gain. Can you believe that?\u201d \n\n The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead \nprickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. \n\n \u201cIf there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal \ngain,\u201d said Griphook finally, \u201cit would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not \nused to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-\ncarriers.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWand-carriers,\u201d repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar \nprickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question \nOllivander next door. \n\n \u201cThe right to carry a wand,\u201d said the goblin quietly, \u201chas long been contested \nbetween wizards and goblins.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, goblins can do magic without wands,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cThat is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other \nmagical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, goblins won\u2019t share any of their magic either,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell \nus how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a \nway wizards have never \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Harry, noting Griphook\u2019s rising color. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about \nwizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature \u2013\u201d \n\n Griphook gave a nasty laugh. \n\n \u201cBut it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, \nyour race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, \nhouse-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe do!\u201d said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \u201cWe protest! \nAnd I\u2019m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I\u2019m a Mudblood!\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t call yourself \u2013\u201d Ron muttered. \n\n \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMudblood, and proud of it! I\u2019ve got no \nhigher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to \ntorture, back at the Malfoys!\u201d \n\n As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut \nBellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. \n\n \u201cDid you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you know \nthat we\u2019ve wanted elves to be freed for years?\u201d (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm \nof Hermione\u2019s chair.) \u201cYou can\u2019t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, \nGriphook!\u201d \n\n The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry. \n\n \u201cWhat do you seek within the Lestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cThe sword \nthat lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.\u201d He looked from one to the other of them. \n\u201cI think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut the fake sword isn\u2019t the only thing in that vault, is it?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cPerhaps \nyou\u2019ve seen other things in there?\u201d \n\n His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the \npulsing of his scar. \n\n The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. \n\n \u201cIt is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians \nof fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so \noften, wrought by our fingers.\u201d \n\n The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione \nto Ron and then back again. \n\n \u201cSo young,\u201d he said finally, \u201cto be fighting so many.\u201d \n\n \u201cWill you help us?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a hope of breaking in without a \ngoblin\u2019s help. You\u2019re our one chance.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cI shall . . . think about it,\u201d said Griphook maddeningly. \n\n \u201cBut \u2013\u201d Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \n\n The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his \nshort legs. \n\n \u201cI think,\u201d he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur\u2019s bed, \u201cthat \nthe Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and \ntook the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry \nthought he saw resentment in the goblin\u2019s eyes", "input_ids": [1, 6677, 4433, 10686, 29892, 14051, 10549, 670, 21990, 6425, 2705, 29889, 29871, 13, 13, 15,

possession of a \nwand?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n Ollivander swallowed. \n\n \u201cNecessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.\u201d \n\n \u201cThere are legends, though,\u201d said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain \nin his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea \ninto action. \u201cLegends about a wand \u2013 or wands \u2013 that have been passed from hand to \nhand by murder.\u201d \n\n Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes \nwere enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. \n\n \u201cOnly one wand, I think,\u201d he whispered. \n\n \u201cAnd You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asked Harry. \n\n \u201cI \u2013 how?\u201d croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione \nfor help. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,\u201d \nsaid Harry. \n\n Ollivander looked terrified. \n\n \u201cHe tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I \u2013 I had no \nchoice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!\u201d \n\n \u201cI understand,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou told him about the twin cores? You said he just \nhad to borrow another wizard\u2019s wand?\u201d \n\n Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He \nnodded slowly. \n\n \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cMine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you \nknow why that is?\u201d \n\n Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. \n\n\f\n \u201cI had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique \nthat night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would \nhave snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . . \n\n\u201cWe were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. \nWhen You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and \nasked about that other wand, didn\u2019t he?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \n\n Harry did not answer. \n\n \u201cYes, he asked,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cHe wanted to know everything I could \ntell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the \nElder Wand.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flaggergasted. \n\n \u201cThe Dark Lord,\u201d said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, \u201chad always \nbeen happy with the wand I made him \u2013 yes and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half \ninches. \u2013 until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, \nmore powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut he\u2019ll know soon, if he doesn\u2019t already, that mine\u2019s broken beyond repair,\u201d \nsaid Harry quietly. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione, sounding frightened. \u201cHe can\u2019t know that, Harry, how \ncould he --?\u201d \n\n\u201cPriori Incantatem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe left your wand and the blackthorn wand at \nthe Malfoys\u2019, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells \nthey\u2019ve cast lately, they\u2019d see that yours broke mine, they\u2019ll see that you tried and failed \nto mend it, and they\u2019ll realize that I\u2019ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.\u201d \n\nThe little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron \ngave Harry a reproachful look, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that now ---\u201d \n\nBut Mr. Ollivander intervened. \n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. \nPotter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly \ninvulnerable.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd will it?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,\u201d said Ollivander, \u201cbut the \nidea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.\u201d \n\n Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first met, of how much \nhe like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the \nidea of the Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it \nrepulsed him. \n\n \u201cYou \u2013 you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?\u201d asked Hermione. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cYes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand\u2019s course \nthrough history. There are gaps, of, course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, \ntemporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying \ncharacteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written \naccounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business \nto study. They have the ring of authenticity.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo you \u2013 you don\u2019t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?\u201d Hermione asked \nhopefully. \n\n\f\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cWhether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its \nhistory is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, \nand arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong \nhands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.\u201d \n\n \u201cMr. Ollivander,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had \nthe Elder Wand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. \n\n \u201cBut how \u2013 how do you -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cNever mind how I know it,\u201d said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar \nburned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, \nbecause it was so much farther north. \u201cYou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had \nthe wand?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt was a rumor,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cA rumor, years and years ago, long \nbefore you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it \nwould be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder \nWand!\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d said Harry. He stood up. \u201cMr. Ollivander, one last thing, and \nthen we\u2019ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe \u2013 the what?\u201d asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. \n\n \u201cThe Deathly Hallows.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Is this still something to do \nwith wands?\u201d \n\n Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He \ndid not know about the Hallows. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThank you very much. We\u2019ll leave you to get some \nrest now.\u201d \n\n Ollivander looked stricken. \n\n \u201cHe was torturing me!\u201d he gasped. \u201cThe Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no \nidea. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cI do,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all \nof this.\u201d \n\n He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, \nFleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They \nall looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and \ncontinued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him.

A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, Crookshanks,\" Hermione cooed through the wickerwork. \"I'll let you out on the train.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You won't,\" snapped Ron. \"What about poor Scabbers, eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck his head inside.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're here, he said. \"Harry, come on.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.\n\u3000\u3000\"In you get, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street.\n\u3000\u3000Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron's disgust, Percy.\n\u3000\u3000The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. They reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then,\" he said, glancing around them. \"Let's do this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.\n\u3000\u3000In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.\n\u3000\u3000Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, there's Penelope!\" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge. stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to talk to you in private,\" Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go away, Ginny,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, that's nice,\" said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.\n\u3000\u3000This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.\n\u3000\u3000The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who d'you reckon he is?\" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor R. J. Lupin,\" whispered Hermione at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"How d'you know that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's on his case,\" she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder what he teaches?\" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid profile.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's obvious,\" whispered Hermione. \"There's only one vacancy, isn't there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that the job was jinxed.\n\u3000\u3000\"well, I hope he's up to it,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"He looks like on, good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway...\" He turned to Harry. \"What were you going to tell us?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. \\When he'd finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, \"Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking for trouble, Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I Don't go looking for trouble,\" said Harry, nettled. \"Trouble usually finds me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\" said Ron shakily.\n\u3000\u3000They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,\" said Ron uncomfortably. \"No one's ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But they'll catch him, won't they?\" said Hermione earnestly. \"I Mean, they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too....\" \"What's that noise?\" said Ron suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked all around the compartment.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's coming from your trunk, Harry,\" said Ron, standing UP and reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast in the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is that a Sneakoscope?\" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one,\" Ron said. \"It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?\" said Hermione shrewdly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry's present to him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stick it back in the trunk,\" Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, \"or it'll wake him up.\"\n\u3000\u3000He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.\n\u3000\u3000\"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron, sitting back down. \"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know much about Hogsmeade?\" asked Hermione keenly.", "input_ids": [1, 470, 10515, 1421, 297, 278, 10329, 359, 310, 10124, 29936, 896, 892, 2086,

You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.\"\n\u3000\u3000The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.\n\u3000\u3000He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.\n\u3000\u3000\"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's still the appeal!\" said Ron fiercely. \"Don't give up Yet, we're working on it!\"\n\u3000\u3000They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively.\n\u3000\u3000\"S'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him that....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at him blubber!\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, listening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?\" said Malfoy. \"And he's supposed to be our teacher!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first -- SMACK!\n\u3000\u3000She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get off, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said shrilly. \"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We'd better go.\"\n\u3000\u3000They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Hermione gone?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe -- maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson.\n\u3000\u3000\"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wh -- what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \"Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry. \"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see you in Divination!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\"\n\u3000\u3000Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered back. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione snorted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.\n\u3000\u3000It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- \"so as to clear the

it can look \nafter itself. It's us we need to worry about.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"Well I don't know how to break this to you,\" said Ron, \"but I think \nthey might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.\" \nAll three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult \n\n\f\nto stop. Harry's ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay \nback on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was \nraw. \n\"What are we going to do, though?\" said Hermione finally, hiccuping \nherself back to seriousness. \"He'll know, won't he? You-Know-Who will know \nwe know about his Horcruxes!\" \n\"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!\" said Ron hopefully, \"Maybe \nthey'll cover up --\" \nThe sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were \nextinguished. Pain cleaved Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing \nin a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor \nat his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. \n\"What did you say to me?\" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear \nburned inside him. The one thing that he had dreaded - but it could not be \ntrue, he could not see how... \nThe goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. \n\"Say it again!\" murmured Voldemort. \"Say it again!\" \n\"M-my Lord,\" stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, \n\"m-my Lord... we t-tried to st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - \nbroke into the - into the Lestranges' vault...\" \n\"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing \nimpostors? Who were they? \n\"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices...\" \n\"And they took?\" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping \nhim, \"Tell me! What did they take?\" \n\"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord...\" \nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He \nwas crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had \nknown. How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? \nThe Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through \nthe room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards \nscattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others \nbehind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, \nand those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, \nfor hearing about the golden cup - \nAlone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him \nin vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality - the \ndiary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew \nabout the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of \nthem? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always \nsuspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was \nhis now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the \nboy - \nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord \nVoldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of \nthem all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how \n\n\f\nmany other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not have known, \nif he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? \nTrue, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had \nthought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... \nNo, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes must be intact... \nBut he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside \nthe goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his \nboiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts - \nA modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he \nhad hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be \nrelated to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never \nbeen traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. \nAnd how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate \nits protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... \nAs for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the \nHorcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place... \nAnd there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to \ndo his bidding, under his protection... \nBut to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding \nplaces, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, \nlike the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone... \nWhich should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease \nflickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore \nmight have made the connection with the Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, \nperhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would \ngo first... \nThe lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility \nthat Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the \norphanage. \nAnd Hogwarts... but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be \nimpossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the \nschool. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that \nthe boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy might \nreturn would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust \nBellatrix and Malfoy. Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how \nunwise it was ever to trust? \nHe would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He \nwould not be parted from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, \nthrough the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he \ncalled the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a \nlong shadow. ... \nHarry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He \nwas lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione \nwere looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the \ncontinued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort's mind \nhad not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that \n\n\f\nhe was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass \nbefore him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. \n\"He knows.\" His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high \nscreams. \"He knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the \nlast one,\" he was already on his feet,\" is at Hogwarts.

Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on the Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' I to run for it....\"\n\u3000\u3000He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\n\u3000\u3000The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\n\u3000\u3000Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then, Neville,\" said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in London?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righto,\" said Stan. \"'Old tight, then.\"\n\u3000\u3000BANG.\n\u3000\u3000They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he didn't know.\n\u3000\u3000Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern.\n\u3000\u3000He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's cage onto the pavement.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry. \"'Bye then!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. \"There you are, Harry,\" said a voice.\n\u3000\u3000Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.\n\u3000\u3000Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.\n\u3000\u3000\"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville?\" he repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I knew it!\" Stan shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is, Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Fudge testily, \"well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over Stan's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly.\n\u3000\u3000`Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn't to know that.\n\u3000\u3000Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you've had us all in a right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and that's what matters.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said Fudge. \"Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry unstuck his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I'm sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.\"\n\u3000\u3000It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now.\n\u3000\u3000\"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge blinked. \"Punishment?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, my dear boy,", "input_ids": [1, 30358, 30358, 29908, 29915, 29923, 279, 1048, 393, 525, 1433, 719, 10173,

Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was \nexamined and given back to him. \n\n Hermione stepped forward. \n\n \"Madam Lestrange!\" said the goblin, evidently startled. \"Dear me!\" How--how \nmay I help you today?\" \n\n \"I wish to enter my vault,\" said Hermione. \n\n The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was \nTravers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work \nto stare at Hermione. \n\n \"You have . . . identification?\" asked the goblin. \n\n \"Identification? I--I have never been asked for identification before!\" said \nHermione. \n\n \"They know!\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"They must have been warned \nthere might be an imposter!\" \n\n \"Your wand will do, madam,\" said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling \nhand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were \naware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. \n\n \"Act now, act now,\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"the Imperious Curse!\" \n\n Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, \nand whispered, for the first time in his life, \"Imperio!\" \n\n A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that \nseemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand \nand the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and \nthen said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" \n\n \"What?\" said Hermione, \"No, no, that's mine--\" \n\n \"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all \naround were watching. \"But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" \n\n Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \n\"Imperio!\" once more. \n\n \"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very \nhandsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't \nyou?\" \n\n Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted \nthe bizarre turn of events without comment. \n\n The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin \napproached. \n\n \"I shall need the Clankers,\" he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a \nmoment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed \nto his senior. \"Good, good! S, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,\" said the old \ngoblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight. \"I shall take you to your \nvault.\" \n\n He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the \ncontents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his \nmouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by \nregarding Travers with confusion. \n\n\f\n \u201cWait \u2013 Bogrod!\u201d \n\n Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. \n\n \u201cWe have instructions,\u201d he said with a bow to Hermione. \u201cForgive me, Madam, \nbut there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.\u201d \n\n He whispered urgently in Bogrod\u2019s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. \n\n \u201cI am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault \u2026 \nVery old family \u2026 old clients \u2026 This way, please \u2026 \u201c \n\n And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. \nHarry looked back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, \nand made his decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, \nwalking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone \npassageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble; they suspect,\u201d said Harry as the door slammed behind them \nand he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: \nneither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of \nHarry Potter in their midst. \u201cThey\u2019re Imperiused,\u201d he added, in response to Hermione and \nRon\u2019s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there \nlooking blank. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did it strongly enough, I don\u2019t know \u2026\u201d \n\n And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange \nshrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: \u201cYou need to mean \nthem, Potter!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cShall we get out now, while we can?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf we can,\u201d said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, \nbeyond which who knew what was happening. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got this far, I say we go on,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cGood!\u201d said Griphook. \u201cSo, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have \nthe authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.\u201d \n\n Harry pointed his wand at Travers. \n\n \u201cImperio!\u201d \n\n The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. \n\n \u201cWhat are you making him do?\u201d \n\n \u201cHide,\u201d said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a \nlittle cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was \nsure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, \nBogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. \n\n With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried past Travers, who \nwas wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through \nthe labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything \nover the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved \nbetween stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They \nmight as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, \nthe more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought \nalong Bellatrix\u2019s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it \u2013 \n\n There were a deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a \nhairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding \nover the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, \u201cNo!\u201d but there was no braking. They \n\n\f\nzoomed through it. Water filled Harry\u2019s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: \nThen, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry \nheard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek \nsomething, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing \npainlessly on the rocky passage floor. \n\n \u201cC-Cushioning Charm,\u201d Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to \nHarry\u2019s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in \noverlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless \nagain. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces. \n\n \u201cThe Thief\u2019s Downfall!\u201d said Gri", "input_ids": [1, 3153, 29892, 29871, 13, 29908, 29931, 1022, 276,

blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence.\n\u3000\u3000\"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Buckbeak,\" Harry murmured, \"come on, we're going to help you. Quietly... quietly...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, let's get this over with,\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid's cabin. \"Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --\"\n\u3000\u3000Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Buckbeak, move!\" Harry hissed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. \"One moment, please, Macnair,\" came Dumbledore's voice. \"You need to sign too.\" The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, hurry!\" she mouthed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees....\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick! Quick!\" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop!\" he whispered to Hermione. \"They might hear us\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.\n\u3000\u3000Silence... then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is it?\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \"Where is the beast?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was tied here!\" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How extraordinary,\" said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Beaky!\" said Hagrid huskily.\n\u3000\u3000There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!\"\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone untied him!\" the executioner was snarling. \"We should search the grounds, the forest.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?\" said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. \"Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"O' -- o' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \"Come in, come in....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" whispered Harry, looking around.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll have to hide in here,\" said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \"We need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for another couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult....\"\n\u3000\u3000She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The sun was setting now.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to have to move,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"We've got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. \"But we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember....\"\n\u3000\u3000They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's Ron!\" said Harry suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\n\u3000\u3000And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's Sirius!\" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron....\n\u3000\u3000\"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?\" said Harry, watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. \"Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--\"\n\u3000\u3000The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And there we go...\" Harry muttered. \"We're in.\"\n\u3000\u3000The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!\" said Hermione. \"If only Dumbledore had come with us...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair and Fudge would've come too,\" said Harry bitterly. \"I bet you anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot....\"\n\u3000\u3000They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Here comes Lupin!\" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.\n\u3000\u3000They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots.\n\u3000\u3000\"If he'd only grabbed the cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lying there....\"\n\u3000\u3000He turned to Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get it and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, we mustn't be seen!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How can you stand this?\" he asked Hermione fiercely. \"Just standing here and watching it happen?\" He hesitated. \"I'm going to grab the cloak!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, no!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"See?\" Hermione whispered. \"See what would", "input_ids": [1, 4091, 540, 8283, 373, 278, 25963, 310, 5306, 472, 480, 299, 776, 1192, 29908,

You might have been an impostor.\" \n\n \"So why aren' you checkin' me?\" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door. \n\n \"You're half-giant,\" said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. \"The Polyjuice Potion is \ndesigned for human use only.\" \n\n \"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,\" said \nHarry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. \"Voldemort \n\n\f\nonly caught up with me toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. \nIf he'd been in on the plan he'd have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\" \n\n \"Voldemort caught up with you?\" said Lupin sharply. \"What happened? How did \nyou escape?\" \n\n Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize \nhim as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have \nsummoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the \nsanctuary of Tonks's parents. \n\n \"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?\" \n\n \"I . . .\" Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic \nand confusion. \"I saw Stan Shunpike . . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor \non the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of \u2013 well, he doesn't know what \nhe's doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!\" \n\n Lupin looked aghast. \n\n \"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill \nyou! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!\" \n\n \"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd \nfallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me \nfrom Voldemort two years ago,\" Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the \nsneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach \nDumbledore's Army how to Disarm. \n\n \"Yes, Harry,\" said Lupin with painful restraint, \"and a great number of Death \nEaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under \nthe imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either \nwitnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\" \n\n \"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\" said Harry angrily. \n\n \"Of course not,\" said Lupin, \"but the Death Eaters \u2013 frankly, most people! \u2013 \nwould have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the \nDeath Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become \nso!\" \n\n Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance \ninside him. \n\n \"I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there,\" said Harry, \"That's \nVoldemort's job.\" \n\n Lupin's retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid \nstaggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths \nand apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. \n\n \"Will George be okay?\" \n\n All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. \n\n \"I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been \ncursed off \u2013\" \n\n There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt \nover Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. \n\n Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized \nthey were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both \nclutching a bent coat hanger, Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley \n\n\f\nshowed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him \nraise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. \n\n \"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!\" \n\n \"'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'\" said Lupin calmly. \n\n Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \"It's him, I've checked!\" \n\n \"All right, all right!\" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, \n\"But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\" \n\n \"So it seems,\" replied Lupin, \"but apparently they did not realize that there would \nbe seven Harrys.\" \n\n \"Small comfort!\" snarled Kingsley. \"Who else is back?\" \n\n \"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.\" \n\n Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. \n\n \"What happened to you?\" Lupin asked Kingsley. \n\n \"Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one,\" Kingsley reeled off, \"and we \nsaw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty \nquickly. Remus, he can \u2013\" \n\n \"Fly,\" supplied Harry. \"I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.\" \n\n \"So that's why he left, to follow you!\" said Kingsley, \"I couldn't understand why \nhe'd vanished. But what made him change targets?\" \n\n \"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"Stan?\" repeated Hermione. \"But I thought he was in Azkaban?\" \n\n Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. \n\n \"Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has \nhushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. But \nwhat happened to you, Remus? Where's George?\" \n\n \"He lost an ear,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"lost an -- ?\" repeated Hermione in a high voice. \n\n \"Snape's work,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"Snape?\" shouted Harry. \"You didn't say \u2013\" \n\n \"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of \nSnape's. I wish I could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep \nGeorge on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood.\" \n\n Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no \nsign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying \nfriends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, \nTonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? \n\n \"Harry, give us a hand!\" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was \nstuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, the headed through the \nempty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still \ntending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight \nHarry saw a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. \n\n \"How is he?\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, \"I can't make it grow back, not when it's \nbeen removed by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse . . . . He's alive.\" \n\n \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Thank God.\" \n\n \"Did I hear someone else in the yard?\" Ginny asked. \n\n\f", "input_ids": [1, 322, 278, 871, 2305, 1058, 1033, 505, 29871, 13, 29873,

through the floor -- someone was moving downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"WE'RE UP HERE!\" Hermione screamed suddenly. \"WE'RE UP HERE -- SIRIUS BLACK - QUICK!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head -- but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't done it.\n\u3000\u3000The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus!\" Lupin shouted.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.\n\u3000\u3000Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is he, Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn't understannd what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.\n\u3000\u3000Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn't move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"But then...\" Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \"... why hasn't he shown himself before now? Unless\" -- Lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, \"-- unless he was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?\"\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin's face, Black nodded.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" Harry interrupted loudly, \"what's going on --?\"\n\u3000\u3000But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black. The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000\"DON'T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. \"You -- you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- you and him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, calm down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't tell anyone!\" Hermione shrieked. \"I've been covering up for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, listen to me, please'\" Lupin shouted. \"I can explain --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.\n\u3000\u3000\"I trusted you,\" he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, \"and all the time you've been his friend!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're wrong,\" said Lupin. \"I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am now -- Let me explain....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"NO!\" Hermione screamed. \"Harry, don't trust him, he's been helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he's a werewolf!\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\" he said. \"Only one out of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his face. \"But I won't deny that I am a werewolf.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get away ftom me, werewolf!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \"How long have you known?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ages,\" Hermione whispered. \"Since I did Professor Snape's essay...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be delighted,\" said Lupin coolly. \"He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin forced a laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have told everyone what you are!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But they already know,\" said Lupin. \"At least, the staff do.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. \"Is he mad?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Some of the staff thought so,\" said Lupin. \"He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"AND HE WAS WRONG!\" Harry yelled. \"YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!\" He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of them, dragging his leg.\n\u3000\u3000I have not been helping Sirius,\" said Lupin. \"If you'll give me a chance, I'll explain. Look --\"\n\u3000\u3000He separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.\n\u3000\u3000There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt \"You're armed, we're not. Now will you listen?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?\n\u3000\u3000\"If you haven't been helping him,\" he said, with a furious glance at Black, \"how did you know he was here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The map,\" said Lupin. \"The Marauder's Map. I was in my office examining it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know how to work it?\" Harry said suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I know how to work it,\" said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. \"I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends' nickname for me at school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You wrote --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn't I\"\n\u3000\u3000He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How d'you know about the cloak?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,\" said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. \"The point is, even if you're wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off", "input_ids": [1, 2996, 515, 2978, 278, 6592, 29936, 10515, 1421, 471, 3755, 17436, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 2855, 769, 2996, 263, 716, 6047, 448,

Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent.\n\u3000\u3000As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.\n\u3000\u3000Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\n\u3000\u3000The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn't want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\u3000\u3000Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends\n\u3000\u3000*281*\n\u3000\u3000everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.\n\u3000\u3000He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner. \"What if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?\"\n\u3000\u3000A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just\n\u3000\u3000three toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,\n\u3000\u3000\"and we could've asked her, and now. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.\n\u3000\u3000But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.\n\u3000\u3000`Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We're still getting exams?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr\n\u3000\u3000*28%*\n\u3000\u3000McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\"\n\u3000\u3000Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn't seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\n\u3000\u3000Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table.\n\u3000\u3000284*\n\u3000\u3000\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, \"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked in days.\n\u3000\u3000\"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry. \"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three days' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they're over.\"\n\u3000\u3000Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn't think who.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her.\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I've only just come off pat", "input_ids": [1, 367, 18758, 1213, 13, 30358, 30358, 29908, 29902, 1010, 540, 2714, 24350, 468, 7656, 29915, 29873, 21682, 7875, 310, 670, 1699, 1497,

Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are they for, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures,\" said Hagrid. \"This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking.\n\u3000\u3000I got somethin' ter discuss with you two,\" said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about her?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- ate Scabbers!\" Ron interjected angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly. \"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case, mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll stand a good chance now...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --\" Harry began awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not blamin' yeh!\" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. \"Gawd knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin' Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha's all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to her --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!\" Ron said angrily. \"But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she won't hear a word against it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets,\" said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's pillow.\n\u3000\u3000They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hogsmeade, next weekend!\" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice. \"What d'you reckon?\" he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes....\" Harry said, even more quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?\" growled Ron, not looking at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!\" said Ron furiously. \"Haven't you done enough damage this year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls' dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000\"So how about it?\" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. \"Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" he said. \"But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.\"\n\u3000\u3000On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Bye!\" Harry called to Ron. \"See you when you get back!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned and winked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Dissendium!\" and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi, Neville,\" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket. \"What are you up to?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" shrugged Neville. \"Want a game of Exploding Snap?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with you!\" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Great, you can help me!\" said Neville, his round face anxious. \"I don't understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it, or --\"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what are you two doing here?\" said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other. \"An odd place to meet --\"\n\u3000\u3000To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're not -- meeting here,\" said Harry. \"We just -- met here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Snape. \"You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Neville set off without another word.

plan, because he hated the sight of her \nwalking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the \ncourtroom behind her. \n\n It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use \nof magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the \nclaustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. \n\n There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; \nthey stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high, raised platform. \nHere, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, \nquite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bight-\nsilver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was \nthere to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That \nwas for the accused to feel, not the accusers. \n\n \u201cSit down,\u201d said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. \n\n Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the \nraised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the \nchair and bound her there. \n\n \u201cYou are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?\u201d asked Umbridge. \n\n Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. \n\n \u201cMarried to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?\u201d \n\n Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!\u201d \n\n Umbridge ignored her. \n\n \u201cMother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred Cattermole?\u201d \nMrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re frightened, they think that I might not come home \u2013\u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cT-took?\u201d sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. \u201cI didn\u2019t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it \nwhen I was eleven years old. It \u2013 it \u2013 it \u2013 chose me.\u201d \n\n She cried harder than ever. \n\n Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She \nleaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold \nswung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket. \n\n Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still \nintent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Umbridge, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose \nwitches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that \nwas sent to you here \u2013 Mafalda, pass them to me.\u201d \n\n Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that \nHarry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione\u2019s hands \nwere shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair \nbeside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s name on it. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s pretty, Dolores,\u201d she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the \nruffled folds of Umbridge\u2019s blouse. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Umbridge, glancing down. \u201cOh yes \u2013 an old family heirloom,\u201d \nshe said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. \u201cThe S stands for Selwyn\u2026. I am \nrelated to the Selwyns\u2026. Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not \nrelated. \u2026A pity,\u201d she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s \nquestionnaire, \u201cthat the same cannot be said for you. \u2018Parents professions: \ngreengrocers\u2019.\u201d \n\n Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and \nthe dementors stood waiting in the corners. \n\n It was Umbridge\u2019s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry\u2019s brain and \nobliterated his sense of caution \u2013 that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty \ncriminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, \nnot even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, \n\u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge \nof the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down \nbelow, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: \nYaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry\u2019s \ndisembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: \n\u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d \n\n \u201cHermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, Mrs. Cattermole!\u201d \n\n Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the \ndementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained \nto the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their \nmasters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. \nCattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and \nforced her face back. \n\n\f\n \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d \n\n The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry\u2019s wand and leaped toward the \ndementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag\u2019s light, \nmore powerful and more warming than the cat\u2019s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it \ncantered around the room. \n\n \u201cGet the Horcrux,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \n\n He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and \napproached Mrs. Cattermole. \n\n \u201cYou?\u201d she whispered, gazing into his face. \u201cBut \u2013 but Reg said you were the one \nwho submitted my name for questioning!\u201d \n\n \u201cDid I?\u201d muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had \na change of heart. Diffindo!\u201d Nothing happened. \u201cHermione, how do I get rid of these \nchains?\u201d \n\u201cWait, I\u2019m trying something up here \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHermione, we\u2019re surrounded by dementors!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket\u2019s gone \u2013 I need to \nduplicate it \u2013 Geminio! There\u2026 That should fool her\u2026.\u201d \n\n Hermione came running downstairs. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026. Relashio!\u201d \n\n The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair.

Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as \nshe raised a shaking arm and screamed, \"But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab \nhim!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in \nfront of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the \nHufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their \nbacks to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and \noverwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from \nunder sleeves. \n\n \n\n \"Thank you, Miss Parkinson.\" said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \n\"You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.\" \n\n \n\n Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins \ntrooping out on the other side of the Hall. \n\n \n\n \"Ravenclaws, follow on!\" cried Professor McGonagall. \n\n \n\n Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but \na number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more \nHufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating \nProfessor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on \ntheir way. \n\n \n\n \"Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!\" \n\n \n\n Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table. \n\n \n\n \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\" \n\n \n\n \"Haven't you found -?\" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. \n\n \n\n But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to \naddress those who had remained behind. \n\n \n\n \"We've only got half an half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A \nbattle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the \nPhoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of \nfighters up to the three highest towers - Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor - where \nthey'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile \nRemus\" - he indicated Lupin - \"Arthur\" - he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the \nGryffindor table - \"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to \norganize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -\" \n\n \n\n \"Sounds like a job for us.\" called Fred, indicating himself and George, and \nKingsley nodded his approval. \n\n \n\n \"All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n \"Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the \nplatform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, \"Aren't you supposed to be looking \nfor something?\" \n\n \n\n \"What? Oh,\" said Harry, \"oh yeah!\" \n\n \n\n He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was \nbeing fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and \nHermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. \n\n \n\n \"Then go, Potter, go!\" \n\n \n\n \"Right - yeah -\" \n\n \n\n He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the \nentrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up \nthe marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. \nFear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to \nconcentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly \nas wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not \nseem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along a passage, \nwhere he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out \nof the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names anywhere on \nit, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of \nRequirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his \nhands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. \n\n \n\n Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. \n\n \n\n There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto \nCarrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation; \nVoldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. \n\n \n\n But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost \ndiadem... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that \nVoldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of \nRavenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem \nin living memory? \n\n \n\n In living memory... \n\n \n\n Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth \nand tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of \nhundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder \nas he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep \ntrack of the students in their own houses, there was much pushing and shouting; Harry \n\n\f\nsaw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and \nthere younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or \nsiblings. \n\n \n\n Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below \nand yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. \n\n \n\n \"Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!\" \n\n \n\n He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom \nof the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for \nhim. \n\n \n\n \"Harry! My dear boy!\" \n\n \n\n Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they \nhad been thrust into icy water. \n\n \n\n \"Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\" \n\n \n\n Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended. \n\n \n\n \"The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -?\" \n\n \n\n \"It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?\" \n\n \n\n \"Let's see...\" \n\n \n\n Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering \nover the heads of the swarming students. \n\n \n\n \"That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.\" \n\n \n\n Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall \nghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away \nthrough a solid wall. \n\n \n\n Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had \ndisappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from \nhim", "input_ids": [1, 310, 27597, 29871, 13, 915,

tried to flush it down a toilet.\"\n\u3000\u3000He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.\n\u3000\u3000*240*\n\u3000\u3000`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\"\n\u3000\u3000His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle's reply. \"You don't have\n\u3000\u3000to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was\n\u3000\u3000 *241*\n\u3000\u3000growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me show you. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\n\u3000\u3000(40K.55\n\u3000\u3000The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\n\u3000\u3000He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.\n\u3000\u3000He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in -\"\n\u3000\u3000But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\"\n\u3000\u3000Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\n\u3000\u3000*242*\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted.\n\u3000\u3000The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\n\u3000\u3000The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on the office door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\n\u3000\u3000A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked nervous.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\"\n\u3000\u3000* 243*\n\u3000\u3000\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Dippet curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are Muggle-born?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And are both your parents -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\n\u3000\u3000\"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's eyes had widened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000*244*\n\u3000\u3000Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"You may go, Tom ......\n\u3000\u3000Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him.\n\u3000\u3000Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\n\u3000\u3000Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person until they", "input_ids": [1, 1250, 29889, 13, 30358, 30358, 29908, 9526, 650, 1898, 304, 28371, 372, 1623, 263, 304, 488, 29873, 1213, 13, 30358, 30358, 3868, 25993,

His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale \nface, the dark red hair. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got loads of magic,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI saw that. All the time I was watching \nyou\u2026\u201d \n\n His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy \nground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily \nas he had watched her in the playground. \n\n \u201cHow are things at your house?\u201d Lily asked. \n\n A little crease appeared between his eyes. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re not arguing anymore?\u201d \n\n \u201cOh yes, they\u2019re arguing,\u201d said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began \ntearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be that long \nand I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t your dad like magic?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anything, much,\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cSeverus?\u201d \n\n A little smile twisted Snape\u2019s mouth when she said his name. \n\n \u201cYeah?\u201d \n\n \u201cTell me about the dementors again.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you want to know about them for?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf I use magic outside school \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who \ndo really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You\u2019re not going to end up \nin Azkaban, you\u2019re too \u2013 \u201d \n\n He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind \nHarry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. \n\n \u201cTuney!\u201d said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to \nhis feet. \n\n \u201cWho\u2019s spying now?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d \n\n Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling \nfor something hurtful to say. \n\n \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re wearing, anyway?\u201d she said, pointing at Snape\u2019s chest. \n\u201cYour mum\u2019s blouse?\u201d \n\n There was a crack. A branch over Petunia\u2019s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The \nbranch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. \n\n \u201cTuney!\u201d \n\n But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. \n\n \u201cDid you make that happen?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo.\u201d He looked both defiant and scared. \n\n \u201cYou did!\u201d She was backing away from him. \u201cYou did! You hurt her!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no, I didn\u2019t!\u201d \n\n But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the \nlittle thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused\u2026 \n\n\f\n And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and \nthree quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, \nsour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a \nshort distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to \nbe pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen. \n\n \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Tuney, I\u2019m sorry! Listen \u2013 \u201d She caught her sister\u2019s hand and held \ntight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \u201cMaybe once I\u2019m there \u2013 no, listen, \nTuney! Maybe once I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade \nhim to change his mind!\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013 want \u2013 to \u2013 go!\u201d said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her \nsister\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a \u2013 a\u2026\u201d \n\n Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners\u2019 \narms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some \nalready in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else \ngreeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. \n\n \u201c \u2013 you think I want to be a \u2013 a freak?\u201d \n\n Lily\u2019s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not a freak,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible thing to say.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re going,\u201d said Petunia with relish. \u201cA special school for \nfreaks. You and that Snape boy\u2026weirdos, that\u2019s what you two are. It\u2019s good you\u2019re \nbeing separated from normal people. It\u2019s for our safety.\u201d \n\n Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an \nair of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, \nand her voice was low and fierce. \n\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was such a freak\u2019s school when you wrote to the headmaster \nand begged him to take you.\u201d \n\n Petunia turned scarlet. \n\n \u201cBeg? I didn\u2019t beg!\u201d \n\n \u201cI saw his reply. It was very kind.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have read \u2013 \u201d whispered Petunia, \u201cthat was my private \u2013 how \ncould you \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. \nPetunia gasped. \n\n \u201cThat boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 not sneaking \u2013 \u201d Now Lily was on the defensive. \u201cSeverus saw the \nenvelope, and he couldn\u2019t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that\u2019s all! \nHe says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of \n\u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cApparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\u201d said Petunia, now as pale \nas she had been flushed. \u201cFreak!\u201d she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her \nparents stood\u2026 \n\n The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the \nHogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his \nschool robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle \nclothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were \n\n\f\ntalking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against \nthe windowpane. \n\n Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at \nhim and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d she said in a constricted voice. \n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\n \u201cTuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo what?\u201d \n\n She threw him a look of deep dislike. \n\n \u201cSo she\u2019s my sister!\u201d \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s only a \u2013 \u201d He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her \neyes without being noticed, did not hear him. \n\n \u201cBut we\u2019re going!\u201d he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \u201cThis \nis it! We\u2019re off to Hogwarts!\u201d \n\n She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019d better be in Slytherin,\u201d said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a \nlittle. \n", "input_ids": [1, 4939, 6677, 29871, 13, 13, 15, 13, 317, 1056, 412, 19066, 22731, 29889, 3600, 4628, 5076, 29892, 19888, 297, 278, 7933, 728, 15482, 290, 29892, 6153, 975,

on!\" \nhe raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading \nthroughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know \nabout? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body.... \n\"HARRY, COME ON!\" screamed Hermione. \nA hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking \ntheir way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a \nfeast... \nHe saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and \nexpire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his \nown wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming \noblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... \nAnd then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and \nHermione's heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures' \napproach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to \nstand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast \nPatronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. \n\"That's right,\" said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in \nthe Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the \nD.A., \"That's right, Harry...come on think of something happy...\" \n'something happy?\" he said, his voice cracked. \n\"We're all still here,\" she whispered, \"we;re still fighting. Come \non, now....\" \nThere was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the \ngreatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of \nHarry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered \nin earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the \nsounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. \n\"Can't thank you enough,\" said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, \nand Seamus \"you just saved--\" \nWith a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came \nlurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, \nbrandishing a club taller than any of them. \n\"RUN!\" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They \nall scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the \n\n\f\ncreature's vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been \nstanding. Harry looked round: ron and Hermione were following him, \nbut the other three had vanished back into the battle. \n\"Let's get out of range!\" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club \nagain and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds \nwehere bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the \ndarkness. \n\"The Whomping willow,\" said Harry, \"go!\" \nSomehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small \nspace into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and \nHagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in \nand outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had \nto reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione \nsaid, the only way to end it-- \nHe sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, \nignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, \nand the sound of hte lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking \nof the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through \ngrounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran \nfaster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw \nthe great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its \nroots with whiplike, slashing branches. \nPanting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's \nswiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick \ntrunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree \nthat would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out \nof breath that she could not speak. \n\"How--how're we going to get in?\" panted ron. \"I can--see the palce- \n-if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--\" \n\"Crookshanks?\" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. \n\"Are you a wizard, or what?\" \n\"Oh--right--yeah--\" \nRon looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground \nand said \"Winguardium Leviosa!\" The twig flew up from the gruond, \nspun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed \ndirectly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying \nbranches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the \nwrithing tree became still. \n\"Perfect!\" panted Hermione. \n\"Wait.\" \nFor one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle \nfilled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, \nwanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? \nBut the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only \nway forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where \nVoldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... \n\n\f\n\"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!\" said Ron, pushing him \nforward. \nHarry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. \nIt was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they \nhad entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to \ndouble up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now \nthere was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand \nilluminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none \ncame. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging \nbeam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to \nslope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged \nat his ankle. \n\"The Cloak!\" she whispered. \"Put the Cloak on!\" \nHe groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth \ninto his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, \nmurmered, \"Nox,\" extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his \nhands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, \nexpecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear \nvoice, see a flash of green light. \nand then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of \nthem, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the \nendo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old \ncrate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he \nopening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. \nThe room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign \nand coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, \nstarry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see \nthe edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a \nwand. \nThen Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away \nfrom where he crouched, hidden. \n\"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--\" \n\"--and it is doing so without your help,\" said Voldemort in his \nhigh, clear voice. \"Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do \nnot think you will make much difference now. We are almost \nthere...almost.\" \n\"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find \nhim, my Lord. Please.\" \nSnape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping \n", "input_ids": [1, 13, 29908, 11457, 1617, 6394, 29892, 10686, 29892, 2041, 373, 3850, 29871, 13, 354, 10425, 670,

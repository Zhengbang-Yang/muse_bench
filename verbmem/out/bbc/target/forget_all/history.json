[{"prompt": "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has asked for forgiveness from the families of the 57 victims of this week's train crash.\n\nIn a Facebook message, Mr Mitsotakis said that \"in the Greece of 2023... two trains heading in different directions cannot run on the same line and no-one notice\".\n\nClashes with police were reported on Sunday as thousands joined a demonstration in the capital Athens.\n\nThey said seven officers were hurt and five arrests were made, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nSome demonstrators set fire to rubbish bins and threw petrol bombs. Police responded by firing tear gas and stun grenades, clearing the central Syntagma Square of the protesters within a few minutes.\n\nThe protesters also reportedly released hundreds of black balloons into the sky in memory of the dead, with some holding signs reading \"Down with killer governments\".\n\nOn the night of 28 February, a passenger train and a freight train that were travelling in opposite directions ended up on the same track.\n\nThe first four carriages of the passenger train were derailed, and the first two caught fire and were almost completely destroyed.\n\nThe train crash has been widely attributed to human error.\n\nA 59-year-old station master in Larissa, who was charged with manslaughter by negligence, appeared in court on Sunday and has been taken into custody.\n\nHis lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said the station master had admitted to having a share of responsibility in the accident. He faces between 10 years and life in jail if convicted.\n\nBut many in Greece see the crash as an accident that had been waiting to happen, and the railway workers' union blamed successive governments' \"disrespect\" towards Greek railways for leading to this \"tragic result\".\n\nA government minister told the BBC that the lack of funding was the direct result of the strict terms of international bailouts imposed after the 2010 debt crisis.\n\nThe scene of the crash near Larissa\n\nUnion members were joined by residents of Athens and Thessaloniki in taking to the streets throughout the past week, shocked by the scale of the disaster. The protests were also attended by many students - several of the passengers on board one of the trains were students in their 20s returning to Thessaloniki after a long weekend celebrating Greek Orthodox Lent.\n\n\"The rail network looked problematic, with worn down, badly paid staff,\" Nikos Savva, a medical student from Cyprus, told AFP news agency.\n\nTrain drivers in Greece have said there have been long-running problems with the electronic systems that are supposed to warn them of danger ahead.\n\nThe transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, also resigned as a \"sign of respect\" for the people who had died. Mr Karamanlis he was taking responsibility for the government's failure to modernise the country's railways in the three-and-a-half years it had been in power.\n\nImmediately after the accident, the Greek government declared three days of national mourning and said the cost of the victims' funerals would be paid for from the public purse.\n\nBBC Europe correspondent Nick Beake says the crash seems to be becoming a defining political issue for Greece as it prepares to face a general election in the spring.\n\nMedia reports have given 9 April as a possible date, but analysts say that date may now be pushed back.\n\nDUP Leader says his party is happy to be involved in talks with all political parties\n\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he is hopeful of progress in the next few weeks in his talks with the government about restoring Stormont.\n\nHe was speaking after parties met the head of the civil service Jayne Brady.\n\nSir Jeffrey said discussions have reached an \"important stage\".\n\nHe added what happens then will determine of the government will be able to meet his party's demands on the protocol and \"be able to deliver what is required\" to restore the Executive.\n\nHe said his party's priority remained getting the solutions it needed on the Northern Ireland protocol which he said was continuing to cause harm.\n\nThe DUP collapsed power-sharing in February 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nHe added that his party was happy to be involved in conversations around how to ease the budgetary pressures", "gt": "\"if and when\" the Executive was restored.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy says there was \"consensus\" within the Stormont parties that they need support with the ongoing financial pressures.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy says there is an elephant in the room around the DUP getting back to work\n\nBut Mr Murphy questioned \"the elephant in the room\" around when the DUP would get back to work.\n\nHe said: \"We are doing preparation work for negotiations that might not happen.\"\n", "response": "being felt across all sectors.\n\n\"We have to recognise that the public finances are in a very difficult place,\" he said.\n\n\"But we also have to recognise that the public services are being squeezed at both ends.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Conor Murphy says the party is ready to serve the

Northern Ireland are teaching pupils that homosexuality is wrong in relationships and sex education (RSE).\n\nA Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) report said \"many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people\" who had sex.\n\nSome told pupils that those who \"engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions\".\n\nThe NIHRC investigated schools policies on the teaching of RSE.\n\nThe detailed investigation found most schools were not providing \"age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on access to abortion services\".\n\n\"Some schools actively contributed to the shame and stigma surrounding unplanned pregnancy and abortion, by making statements such as 'abortion is not a means of contraception and those who knowingly engage in casual sex must bear the consequences of their actions',\" the NIHRC report said.\n\nIt also said about two-thirds of post-primaries promoted abstinence in their sex education policies.\n\nOne school's policy stated that \"sexual abstinence before marriage and fidelity within it, will be presented as the positive and desirable option and an achievable reality\".\n\nThe commission recommended that schools should be monitored to ensure sex education is taught in \"an objective and non-judgemental manner\".\n\nThat should include \"detailed assessments of the content and delivery of lesson plans\".\n\nThe NIHRC was established following the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nIt has the power to conduct investigations and compel evidence.\n\nIts investigation into relationships and sex education focused mainly on legal and policy matters but it also made recommendations on delivery of the subject in schools.\n\nAbout three-quarters (149) of post-primaries in Northern Ireland provided evidence to the commission's investigation and 124 provided their RSE policies.\n\nSome schools provided lesson plans and teaching notes, and experts were also consulted by the commission.\n\nSpeaking about the findings, NIHRC chief commissioner, Alyson Kilpatrick told Good Morning Ulster that \"an awful lot more needed to be done by a majority of schools in relation to age appropriate, comprehensive, scientifically accurate education and sexual reproductive health and rights\".\n\n\"The Department for Education needs to work with schools, consult with parents and children, to work out what the appropriate content should be and that it is delivered properly,\" said Ms Kilpatrick.\n\nIn 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) said RSE in Northern Ireland should be compulsory and comprehensive.\n\nAs a result, the Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris recently laid new regulations in parliament making teaching topics like abortion and prevention of pregnancy compulsory in schools in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe said he had a legal duty to act on the recommendations made in the CEDAW report.\n\nBut the change has been criticised by Protestant and Catholic church leaders.\n\nThe NIHRC investigation into RSE was carried out before Mr Heaton-Harris's move.\n\nBut the commission said that there must be monitoring to \"ensure that schools are meeting their new obligations\".\n\n\"It's very easy to have a policy or to have a list of things you are going to teach, but it is the actual teaching of them and the way in which they are taught which is so influential,\" said Ms Kilpatrick.\n\nAt present, each school in Northern Ireland has to teach sex education but can decide what to teach \"based on the ethos of their school,\" according to Department of Education (DE) guidance.\n\nThe NIHRC said that the majority of schools who submitted their RSE policy to the investigation \"still promoted the value of the'sanctity of marriage'\", and related terms, such as \"permanent committed sexual relationship\", and \"married love\" in their RSE policies and school ethos.\n\n\"In addition to this idealisation and promotion of abstinence, marriage, and monogamy, many schools use language that shames and stigmatises young people who do engage in sexual practices,\" the report continued.\n\n\"Most schools also contributed to this association of shame with sexual activity, by attributing specific moral values", "gt": "and personal characteristics to those who engaged (or did not engage) in sexual behaviour.\"\n\nThe NIHRC said about two-thirds of post-primaries taught pupils about contraception, but it was difficult to know if they offered accurate information.\n\nIn their RSE policies, some schools stated that \"they will present the Catholic teaching that 'the use of any artificial means of preventing procreation is not acceptable',\" the report said.\n\n\"Some schools even outline their beliefs that \"homosexuality\" is wrong,\" in their polices, the NIHRC", "response": "and personal characteristics to those who engaged (or did not engage) in sexual behaviour.\"\n\nThe NIHRC said that while their investigation showed some schools provided accurate information and used language that did not shame or stigmatise

Her family described her as \"amazing\" and an \"inspiration\".\n\nThey announced her death in a post on her Instagram page. \"We are deeply saddened to announce the death of Dame Deborah James; the most amazing wife, daughter, sister, mummy,\" it said.\n\nShe passed away peacefully surrounded by her family.\n\nHer family said Dame Deborah shared her experience of cancer to \"raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer\".\n\n\"Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring.\"\n\nDame Deborah was praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016.\n\nA deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun and becoming a BBC broadcaster.\n\nBut on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left.\n\n\"My body just can't continue any more,\" she said in a post on her @bowelbabe Instagram account.\n\nShe also launched a new fund, called the Bowelbabe fund, to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients.\n\nIt surpassed \u00a31m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of \u00a3250,000 - and has now raised almost \u00a37m.\n\nIn May, she was given a damehood by Prince William at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, where she had chosen to stay.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - who donated to the research fund - praised her \"tireless efforts\" and thanked her for \"giving hope\" to those living with the disease.\n\nFor her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was \"surreal\".\n\n\"You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,\" she said.\n\nThe money raised through her Bowelbabe fund will support Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Hospital - a specialist cancer treatment facility.\n\nBowel Cancer UK, of which Dame Deborah was a patron, said she had turned her bowel cancer diagnosis \"into an incredible force for good\" and would save countless lives through her campaigning.\n\nGenevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher had an \"incredible energy\" and a \"marvellous knack of making things happen\".\n\nPaying tribute to the presenter's awareness-raising work, Ms Edwards said: \"She had this incredible power to connect with people. She leaves a tremendous legacy behind her\".\n\nDame Deborah campaigned to raise awareness about bowel cancer, urging people to check for symptoms, during and after her treatment.\n\nFollowing one operation, while in an anaesthetic daze, she ordered a poo costume online - which she would wear while recording her podcast.\n\nSigning off her final podcast in May, she said: \"Check your poo.

Most of those incidents there was no requirement for police to attend.\"\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley wrote to health and social care services in Greater London in May, informing them the service would stop attending mental health incidents from September, except where there is an \"immediate threat to life\".\n\nHumberside Police introduced the Right Care, Right Person scheme in 2020 to ensure mental health calls are dealt with by relevant professionals.\n\nMr Cooke welcomed investment that had seen more than 20,000 police officers added in England and Wales since 2020.\n\nHowever, he noted difficulties in vetting new recruits and the inexperience of a workforce which lost many established officers during David Cameron's time as prime minister.\n\nFurthermore, where failings have been identified, some forces have been too slow to implement improvements, he said.\n\nMr Cooke called on Home Secretary Suella Braverman to grant new enforcement powers to enforce compliance with the Inspectorate of Constabulary's recommendations by the end of this year.\n\nForces had taken too long to respond to recommendations in the 2016 State of Policing report relating to officers abusing their positions for sexual purposes, he said.\n\n\"Two forces did from the start what they should have done,\" Mr Cooke said. \"That should have been 43 forces.\n\n\"In those seven years, we have seen some truly horrendous acts by officers.\n\n\"The chances of these things happening would have been lessened had we had those powers at an earlier time.\n\n\"It would ensure police chiefs across the country would have to make the changes that are required to keep the public safe.\"\n\nLabour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called the report \"truly damning\" and backed major reforms. She blamed successive Conservative home secretaries for a series of failings.\n\n\"These include systemic failings in policing and a totally dysfunctional criminal justice system, with more criminals getting away with crimes, victims let down, vital neighbourhood policing devastated, record numbers of forces in special measures, and confidence in policing falling,\" she said.\n\nMs Braverman said the report acknowledged a fall in crime rates but conceded \"there is lots more to do\".\n\nShe added: \"This is why I've been calling for common-sense policing. With the highest number of police officers than ever before, the police must deliver for victims.\n\n\"It has always been my priority to reduce burdens on policing and ensure they have the resources", "gt": "they need.\"\n\nBaroness Louise Casey, who authored a damning report on the Met earlier this year, told the BBC's Political Thinking podcast that for people to consent to policing, officers need to be seen as \"beyond reproach\" on issues like violence against women.\n\nShe said: \"The thing I still feel is fairly unforgivable is that misconduct in a police officer is totally undermining of the fact that they can arrest me, they can cuff me, they can strip search me, they can literally take my clothes off and strip search me", "response": "they need to keep us safe.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

The confrontation billed as a potential title-decider turned into an embarrassingly one-sided affair. Pep Guardiola's side, now two points behind Arsenal with two games in hand, were inspired by the devastating partnership of Erling Haaland and Kevin de Bruyne. Haaland sent De Bruyne away for a silky opener after seven minutes, and Arsenal then survived a constant bombardment of attacks before John Stones headed home from a free-kick in first-half stoppage time, the goal given by VAR after originally being ruled offside. City goal machine Haaland was outstanding throughout and again set up De Bruyne for the third in the 54th minute, the Belgian passing a classy finish between the legs of Gunners defender Rob Holding. Holding pulled one back for Arsenal late on before Haaland, denied four times by Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale earlier in the match, sealed a memorable night with his 49th City goal. City can go top with victory at Fulham on Sunday while Arsenal must somehow pull out of a slump that has seen them go four league games without a win at a crucial stage of the season.\n\u2022 None Title in our hands and we must use that - Guardiola\n\u2022 None Reaction from Man City-Arsenal, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League games\n\u2022 None How did you rate Man City's performance?

Send us your views here City still have work to do to retain their title but, in the biggest game of the Premier League season, they delivered a brutal message. Guardiola was as fired up as his players in the early stages, raging in his technical area, even giving an animated lecture to goalkeeper Ederson after De Bruyne put them ahead. City were at their magnificent best as they tore holes in the Arsenal rearguard, the Gunners miraculously surviving all manner of close shaves after the opener before Stones' header gave them the cushion they deserved. Haaland had a rare night when his golden touch in front of goal deserted him until virtually the last kick of the game - although Ramsdale played his part in that - but the Norwegian demonstrated just how much his all-round game has improved under Guardiola by giving an exhibition in link-up play, twice assisting for De Bruyne and playing with an air of constant menace. And De Bruyne once more showed his enduring class with two precision finishes. The title is not run yet and no-one at City will be complacent, but this performance carried all the hallmarks of a side on a mission to keep their crown and who now have all the momentum with them.

This means they can explode at a later date, killing or injuring people.\n\nNeither the US, Ukraine or Russia are signatories of the international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - banning the use or stockpiling", "gt": "of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said the UK is \"signatory to a convention which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use\".\n\n\"We will continue to do our part to support Ukraine against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, but we've done that by providing heavy battle tanks and most recently long-range weapons, and hopefully all countries can continue to support Ukraine,\" he added.\n\n", "response": "of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Hiroshima, Japan, where he is attending a G7 summit, Mr Sunak said the convention \"discourages the use of cluster munitions and discourages the stockpiling of cluster munitions\".\n\n\"We are firmly committed to the convention and the UK is one of 123 countries that are signed up to it,\" he said.\n\n\"We continue to support Ukraine, but our support is within the bounds of the law and", "rougeL": 0.42603550295857984, "rougeL_recall": 0.41379310344827586, "rouge1": 0.5562130177514792, "rouge1_recall": 0.5402298850574713}, {"prompt": "with the findings of that report - and missed last month's vote to approve it, blaming a diary clash.\n\nThe follow-up report by the Privileges Committee, published last week, said several allies of Mr Johnson had sought to \"influence the outcome\" of its original probe into the former prime minister.\n\nIt accused the seven MPs and three peers, all Conservatives, of mounting attacks on the committee designed to \"discredit\" its findings.\n\nThe report has led to a free speech row, with several of those named, including Ms Dorries and Sir Jacob, saying there is no reason they should not be able to criticise its conclusions.\n\nAt a scheduled appearance at the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Sunak did not respond to a question from Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant about whether the MPs named should apologise.\n\nInstead, he said he had not read the report - which runs to a handful of pages - from \"cover to cover,\" although he was aware of its findings.\n\nHe confirmed he had asked Lord Zac Goldsmith, one of the Tory peers named in the report, to apologise - but said this was because of his then role as an environment minister.\n\nLord Goldsmith quit his government post last week, citing unhappiness with green policies.

Mr Prigozhin has also targeted top Russian military officials, criticising them publicly for not supplying his troops with enough ammunition.\n\nIn his latest video claiming control of Bakhmut, Mr Prigozhin said \"no-one can pedantically reproach us for the fact that at least some piece was not taken\".\n\nExplosions can be heard in the background, suggesting fighting continues close to the city, if not inside it.\n\nHe also promised to hand the city over to regular Russian troops later in the month.\n\nHis claims were echoed by the Russian defence ministry on Saturday night, state media in Moscow reported.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin claimed to control Bakhmut in a video flanked by Wagner fighters\n\nBut in a statement on the messaging platform Telegram moments afterwards, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said: \"Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical.\n\n\"As of now, our defenders control some industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area and the private sector.\"\n\nWestern officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Bakhmut, while Ukraine's military has also paid a heavy price.\n\nThere is hardly a building left unscathed, and the city's entire population has vanished.\n\nThe latest Wagner claim came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went to Japan to attend a meeting of the leaders of the world's most industrialised countries, the G7.\n\nHis Western allies pledged more support, including taking a significant step towards providing F-16 fighter jets, and announced more sanctions on Russia.\n\nRussian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year and control parts of its east.\n\nUkraine has been expected to launch an offensive to retake seized territories, but Mr Zelensky recently said that more time is needed to prepare.\n\nHe has called Bakhmut \"a fortress\" of Ukrainian morale.\n\nUkraine's hope is that the fight over Bakhmut has blunted Russia's ability to conduct its own offensive operations, and exhausted its army and supplies.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But as far as I can see it probably cannot be completely clear cut.

The statement from the special prosecutors says the charges against her remain unchanged.\n\nA lawyer for Ms Gutierrez-Reed told BBC News that they \"fully expect at the end of this process that Hannah will also be exonerated\".\n\nAccording to the LA Times, prosecutors had recently learned that the gun used in the shooting, a.45 Colt revolver, had been modified with a new trigger in a way that could have made a misfire more likely.\n\nThursday's statement by prosecutors made no mention of the gun, but said that the newly revealed facts \"demand further investigation and forensic analysis\".\n\nProsecutors had accused Mr Baldwin, 65, of showing a \"reckless\" disregard for the safety of his colleagues.\n\nMr Nikas, a lawyer for the star of The Hunt for Red October, previously called the initial decision to charge his client \"a terrible miscarriage of justice\".\n\n\"Mr Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun - or anywhere on the movie set,\" Mr Nikas said.\n\n\"He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post after the announcement was made, the 30 Rock actor thanked his lawyer and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin.\n\n\"I owe everything I have to this woman.

She and O'Ceallaigh were a couple, but their relationship was on the rocks. Prince's lovelorn lyrics matched her own state of mind. If he was gone, she could do whatever she wanted, she could see whomever she chose - but nothing would compare to him.\n\n\"They were in the process of breaking up when we recorded Nothing Compares 2 U,\" said Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the song, in an interview with Sound On Sound.\n\n\"That's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.\"\n\nAt this point, it's a good idea to go and listen to The Family's original recording or Prince's demo, which was released in 2018. The song is there, but it's all dressed up in Paisley finery. Every line ends with a baroque piano figure, the bridge is drowning in syrupy strings, there's even a saxophone solo.\n\nWhatever emotion Prince was channelling, he did his best to hide it. O'Connor did the opposite.\n\nWorking with Japanese jazz virtuoso Gota Yashiki and Soul II Soul producer Nellee Hooper, she put a line through all the ornate R&B flourishes and pared the song back its bare essentials.\n\nThe arrangement is simple - a drum loop, some gauzy strings and a haunting choir of backing vocals. They're pushed and pulled by the tidal wave of her voice, like sand on a beach, as she wrestles with various stages of devastation.\n\nShe starts quietly, almost cowering as she sings: \"It's been seven hours and 15 days since you took your love away.\" Then she's defiant: \"Since you been gone, I can do whatever I want\" but her bravado collapses into anguish once she realises that \"nothing will take away these blues\".\n\nBy the chorus, she's face to face with grief. Her voice strives for power, but it cracks again. Then, In a change to Prince's melody, she shifts the pitch of the final \"to you\" to a despondent monotone, the dissonance illustrating her pain.\n\nIt's one of the all-time great vocal performances.\n\nO'Connor's other hits include Mandinka, I Am Stretched On Your Grave and Thank You For Hearing Me\n\nIn O'Connor's hands, Nothing Compares 2 U was always going to be a hit, but the video made it a phenomenon.\n\nDirector John Maybury shot several hours of footage of the singer walking through a washed-out Paris. You can see glimpses of it in the finished promo - O'Connor dressed in black, reflected in the Seine, walking through the stunning Parc de Saint-Cloud.\n\nBut once she'd performed the song to the camera, Maybury knew her close-up had to be the focus.\n\nFrom the beginning, O'Connor stares straight at us, her pale green eyes peering out of the screen, searching for connection. But as she sings, she breaks eye contact, glancing down, as though she's unable to keep her emotions in check.\n\nAt the end, famously, two tears roll down her cheeks.\n\nThose tears were genuine, and they represented a loss Prince could never have imagined when he wrote Nothing Compares 2 U in the middle of his Purple Rain hot streak.\n\nO'Connor's mother had died in a car crash in 1986, when the singer was still a teenager.

The current rules governing mifepristone remain in effect until the Supreme Court eventually does decide on the merits of the original Texas order, or (less likely) lets whatever the appeals court decides stand without review.\n\nThis effectively kicks the can down the road months and possibly well into 2024, when a final court decision could come down in the shadow of the next presidential election.\n\nTwo justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, openly dissented from the majority. The latter went into detail on why he would have let the Fifth Circuit's appeal court's ruling stand.\n\nHe wrote that the circuit court's stay would not have caused \"irreparable harm\" to the FDA or to Danco Laboratories, which manufactures the drug.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Why anti-abortion campaigners still march after Roe was overturned\n\nNeither Mr Alito nor the majority decision expressed any opinion about mifepristone's ultimate fate. Given the conservative-leaning court's abortion ruling last year, however, its final decision in the case could very well anger the abortion-rights groups that on Friday were celebrating.\n\nThe case is now back in the hands of the Fifth Circuit appeals court, where six of its 16 judges were appointed by Donald Trump and only four by Democratic presidents.\n\nLast week, two Trump-selected judges on that court issued a lengthy opinion that, among other things, said it was \"unlikely\" that the challenge to at least some of the FDA's decisions authorising mifepristone would fail. A third judge (appointed by former Republican President George W Bush) disagreed.\n\nThose three judges will hear oral arguments in the case in May and could issue a decision weeks or even months later. That ruling could then be reviewed by the full 15-judge circuit before the losing side has the opportunity to appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThere is a likelihood that when this case once again lands on the steps of the high court, it will do so with a ruling that curtails the availability of the abortion drug.\n\nEven that, however, could be just the beginning.\n\nThis current legal battle is just over a temporary hold on the FDA's mifepristone approval. Once this round of appeals has concluded, the case will head back to the Texas court for a trial on the merits of the case, possibly with witness testimony.\n\nAfter that court issues its final decision, the appeals process will start all over again.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMeanwhile, the opinion of the general public continues to land heavily in favour of existing policies relating to the abortion pill.

Even though the White Paper is an effort to manage one of the biggest technological changes in history, blink and you might have missed it.\n\nThe government wants, for now, to give existing regulators like the Health and Safety Executive the responsibility of keeping an eye on what is going on. The argument is that AI will potentially have a role in every aspect of our lives, in endless ways, so to create one new big referee is the wrong approach. One minister told me that \"it's a whole revolution\" so \"identifying it as one technology is wrong\".\n\nMinisters also want the UK to make the most of its undoubted expertise in the field because AI is big business with huge potential benefits.\n\nThe government is reluctant to introduce tight regulation that could strangle innovation.

Predictions about the potential of technology are often wildly wrong.

It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences.\n\nSome of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria.\n\nA shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force.\n\nBut Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side.\n\nSince the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital.\n\nIran accuses Israel of carrying out the deadly air strike on its consular building in Damascus\n\nIn interviews here in northern Israel local officials and residents have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah and force them back from the border.\n\nThey were not put off by Israel's experience in the last two decades of the 20th Century, when it occupied a broad strip of South Lebanon to try to protect northern Israel. It even created its own Lebanese militia to help with the fighting. The Israelis pulled out in 2000, under constant military harassment from Hezbollah, after prime minister Ehud Barak, a former head of the army, decided that occupying south Lebanon (Israel called it the \"security zone\") did not make Israelis any safer and wasted the lives of its troops.\n\nI walked through the ruins of the Avivim winery, which is right on the border wire. It was destroyed in a Hezbollah strike last week. Its owner Shlomi Biton showed me through the wreck of his business. He is 47 and was born in Avivim, which like the rest of northern Israel has become a ghost town after the evacuations. Shlomi fought in Lebanon during his military service, and now believes that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for Israel to return to Lebanon for a decisive battle with Hezbollah.\n\n\"There's no other choice,\" he told me next his burnt-out business. \"Otherwise, the community won't return to live here, maybe just a few crazy guys like me - the children won't come back.\"\n\nIn Kiryat Shmona, a border town where 25,000 Israelis lived, no more than 3,000 people, mostly soldiers and essential workers, are left.

Although its role has often been overshadowed by the newer and more adaptable Spitfire plane, the Hurricane actually shot down more than half of all enemy aircraft during the battle.\n\n\"The Hurricane was a strong, easy to fly machine,\" Mr Shtan says. \"It was stable as a gun platform and suitable for inexperienced pilots. A reliable aircraft.\"\n\nIn total, about 3,000 Hurricanes were sent to the USSR between 1941 and 1944 to support the Soviet war effort. Most were either destroyed in combat or dismantled later for parts.\n\nBut some Hurricanes were deliberately broken up and buried after the war so the Soviets did not have to pay back the United States. Under the Lend-Lease legislation, the USSR was required to pay for any donated military equipment that remained intact after hostilities ended.\n\nThis was the fate of the eight Hurricanes found buried in woodland south of Kyiv - now the capital of independent Ukraine, but until 1991 part of the USSR.\n\nUkraine is now painstakingly cleaning and repairing the planes, so they can be put on display\n\nThey had been stripped of their instruments, radios, machine guns and any useful scrap metal. They were then dragged by tractors from a nearby airfield, broken up and dropped without ceremony into a shallow ravine. It is thought they were then covered with earth by bulldozers.\n\nThe remains were discovered recently after an unexploded bomb dating from the war was found nearby. The rest of the ravine was checked using metal detectors and the Hurricanes were found.\n\nThe National Aviation Museum of Ukraine is now in the process of painstakingly excavating the site by hand.

And the government says its funding will continue until at least July 2024.\n\nBut in Northern Ireland, Department for Education funding to provide period products in schools has been cut by 40%.\n\nIn some schools and colleges, the Period Products Scheme is working well.\n\nAt Harlow College, in Essex, a tote bag filled with pads and tampons hangs on the back of unisex toilet cubicle doors.\n\nGill Atkinson, from the college's wellbeing and safeguarding team, says access to products has not only removed stigma and shame around periods, it has also helped improve attendance.\n\nThe college has spent its allocated \u00a37,000 on products this year and is hopeful funding will continue.\n\n\"I don't think the college would be able to fund it themselves,\" Gill says.\n\nAs well as providing free tampons and sanitary pads, Gill's team distributes other products, including period underwear, which she says are increasingly popular\n\nStaff at Portland College, in Mansfield, Notts, a residential college for young disabled people, say the Period Products Scheme has helped their students to feel comfortable talking about periods.\n\nSpeech-and-language therapist Amy Smith-Patrick says some pupils need support to use the period products, so it would not be appropriate to leave pads in toilets for students to help themselves to.\n\nOthers", "gt": "are non-verbal, so used to struggle to know how to ask for the products they needed.\n\nNow, students on their period can hand in a slip at reception or in class, in exchange for products - removing communication barriers and embarrassment.\n\nPeriod underwear has been a \"real positive\" for students with autism, Amy adds, as it can be more comfortable for those with sensory-processing difficulties.\n\nIn some situations, it can be hard to cater for everybody's needs.\n\nMinnie, 13, from Sheffield, tells", "response": "may not have the fine motor skills to open a sanitary-pad packet, so staff have to open it for them.\n\nBut Amy says the students \"love\" that they have their own \"special\" pads, which they collect at the start of each period.\n\n\"It's really important that we normalise periods and Amy says the students love having their own \"special\" pads\n\n\"We've had some students who were previously unable to verbalise that they were on their period, but now they can say, 'I need my pad',\" she says.\n\n\"", "rougeL": 0.12643678160919541, "rougeL_recall": 0.13095238095238096, "rouge1": 0.26436781609195403, "rouge1_recall": 0.27380952380952384}, {"prompt": "Easter sales to buy things we need.

She deserves a treat because she really helped us out last week when our little boy had his tonsils and adenoids out.\n\nOver the weekend, we spent money on an Easter trail, so we're trying to keep the costs down today.\n\nJanine tried to keep her kids entertained during school holidays without breaking the bank\n\nThe weather was nice, so we dashed out to the park in the morning. I use vouchers, coupons and promotions for little treats like coffee, or eating out.\n\nWe needed some food from Tesco so I tied it into the day out. I spent just under \u00a315.00 on bits for tea.

If we run out in between we go to Aldi.\n\nIt rained all day in Manchester, typical in the school holidays. I took the kids for lunch to M&S because kids eat for free. It cost \u00a319.51.\n\nI met some friends today. We all live in different parts of the country so Birmingham was the middle ground.\n\nI made sandwiches for the train to save on money and took a bottle of water with me.

It was simply that this \"amazing chapter\" of her life had \"naturally come to an end\".\n\n\"I am a mum now and I never really gave myself a maternity leave and I got straight back into work instantly because my work is my phone and showing my life is my work,\" she continued.\n\n\"The last thing I would want to be is in a role that I can't fulfil right this moment.\"\n\nHer departure comes two months after longstanding PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani left the Boohoo Group brand, to pursue new opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, Hague announced she was taking a new direction by accepting a senior job with the label. \"I'm excited to be a creative director - I'm not an influencer any more and people can see that, it's become a lot more than that,\" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\n\"I'm basically going to eat, sleep, breathe PrettyLittleThing - although I do that anyway\".\n\nIt was a big and controversial signing at the time, with some commentators suggesting it was unfair she had walked from the Love Island villa into a hugely influential fashion job.\n\nHague argued she had worked hard and was passionate about the brand, one she had decided to work with despite having been offered more money to go elsewhere.\n\nShe said she had turned down an offer of \u00a32 million to work with a high street brand, simply because she did not wear their clothes.\n\nAt the time she said she wanted to improve the inclusivity of the brand by creating clothes in sizes 4-30, as well as encouraging people to remove cosmetic fillers, if, like her, they had felt they'd made a mistake.\n\n\"I think for me it was a journey of accepting that you don't need to get all these things done to your face, you're fine the way you are,\" she said.\n\nHague was also criticised for her involvement with the company after PrettyLittleThing owner BooHoo was accused of paying garment workers in Leicester only \u00a33.50 per hour following a 2020 investigation by The Sunday Times.\n\nThe following year, BooHoo said: \"We recognise the risks of poor labour practices, human rights abuses and modern slavery in complex global supply chains and we are committed to establishing robust due diligence programmes and collaborating with others from the industry, authorities and NGOs to tackle poor practices and protect those people who are most", "gt": "vulnerable.\"\n\nLast year, Hague had an Instagram post banned after she failed to include any mention of it being an advert.\n\nIt was the third time she had been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).\n\nShe posted a picture of her wearing a PrettyLittleThing dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.\n\nThe ASA said it was not \"immediately clear\" that she had a commercial interest in PLT.

That thought from Orwell and the questions it raises for the BBC are at the very heart of the Lineker debate.\n\nIsrael's military said the strike on World Central Kitchen's convoy was a \"grave mistake\" and vowed to protect aid workers\n\nMany Palestinians in the Gaza Strip will be wondering how they are going to feed their families after World Central Kitchen (WCK) paused its operations in response to the killing of seven of its aid workers in an Israeli air strike.\n\nAnother US charity it works with, Anera, has also suspended work because of the escalating risks faced by its local staff and their families.\n\nTogether, they were serving two million meals a week across the Palestinian territory, where the UN has warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of Israeli restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of order.\n\nWCK's decision to pause its work also led to the \"freezing\" of a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus, which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of Gaza and avert a looming famine.\n\nThe WCK convoy was hit on Monday night as it travelled south along the Israeli-designated coastal aid route, just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food from a barge at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah.\n\nThat barge was part of a four-vessel flotilla that sailed back to Cyprus with 240 tonnes of supplies that could not be brought ashore in the wake of the strike.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned that \"what happened to World Central Kitchen threatens the entire aid system\" and had left it \"on the brink\".\n\nBefore the strike, World Central Kitchen was providing about 350,000 meals across Gaza each day\n\nWCK accused the Israeli military of a \"targeted attack\" on vehicles clearly marked with the charity's logo and whose movements had been co-ordinated with Israeli authorities. The victims were British, Polish, Australian and Palestinian, and also included a dual US-Canadian citizen.\n\nThe military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, described the strike as a \"grave mistake\" that had followed \"misidentification at night\".\n\nHe also vowed to take \"immediate action\" to ensure that more was done to protect aid workers, including the immediate establishment of a new \"humanitarian command centre\" to improve co-ordination. \"Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza,\" he stressed.\n\nHowever, aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes. They also assert that this was not an isolated incident, with 196 Palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in October.\n\nJan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief, told the BBC that WCK was \"among those who have the closest co-operation with the Israelis\", in terms of sharing information about their workers' locations and planned movements.\n\nBefore the strike, WCK was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in Gaza, with 400 Palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system.\n\nWCK has provided 12% of the 193,000 tonnes of aid", "gt": "from international organisations that had reached Gaza since October, according to data from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries. However, UN agencies were responsible for 80% of the total.\n\nWCK's founder, the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that it was \"analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do\".\n\nAnera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with WCK - said it understood", "response": "from international organisations that had reached Gaza since October, according to data from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries.\n\nIn a statement, WCK said it would try to find other ways to get food into Gaza, but that it was \"clear that the current model is no longer viable\".\n\nBefore the strike, WCK was providing about 350,000 meals across Gaza each day, it said.\n\nAnera, which was providing 100,000 meals a day in", "rougeL": 0.49056603773584906, "rougeL_recall": 0.4936708860759494, "rouge1": 0.5408805031446542, "rouge1_recall": 0.5443037974683544}, {"prompt": ", according to Cogat.\n\nBut Nate Mook, who was chief executive of WCK until 2022, warned that the longer-term consequences could be \"devastating\" for Gazans because \"we probably have not seen the last of the aid organisations to pull out\".\n\nZawar Ali of International Medical Corps told the BBC that it was reconsidering its safety protocols and whether to restrict its workers' movements.\n\nIt had already decided to relocate its field hospital from the north of Rafah to al-Mawasi, an area to the west which the Israeli military has declared \"humanitarian zone\" but has still carried out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets.\n\nDr Bashar Murad, the executive director of the Palestinian Red Crescent, said many of its paramedics were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulances due to the lack of safety guarantees, despite their protection under international law and co-ordination efforts by international organisations.\n\nAseel Baidoun of Medical Aid for Palestinians said it had not suspended operations after a strike in January damaged a residential compound in al-Mawasi that housed the British charity's local team and their families, injuring several people. But now, she added: \"We really are scared of the security [situation].\"\n\n\"If a foreigner with international immunity is bombed and killed, then what will they do to us?\" Mohammed Aborjela, a Palestinian online content creator who launched the Youth of Gaza initiative to deliver aid after the war began, told BBC.\n\nHe said Palestinian aid workers faced higher risks and greater challenges than their international colleagues, but insisted it would not stop him and his colleagues continuing their work. \"The danger of not providing aid is no less important than the danger of being killed,\" he added.\n\nNatalia Anguera of Action Against Hunger also said it would try to continue working despite \"more and more challenging\" conditions.\n\n\"Most of our staff are... Palestinians. They are suffering themselves, but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate. They want to go on delivering,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe said the international community needed to push strongly for a humanitarian ceasefire because it was the only way that aid organisations would be able to scale up their response to the level required.\n\nMr Egeland also stressed the importance of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which he said was \"bigger than the rest of us combined\" but was being \"systematically undermined by Israel\".\n\nIsrael accuses UNRWA of supporting Hamas, which triggered the war when its gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year. The agency has denied this, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks.\n\nUNRWA called for a \"complete reversal in policies\" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.\n\nThe victim was found outside a house in Brentwick Gardens on Wednesday morning\n\nPolice say 10 people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally stabbed in London.\n\nOfficers said the man was found in the street with serious injuries in Brentwick Gardens, Brentford, at 05:15 BST and died at the scene.\n\nIt came after the force was alerted to reports of intruders at an address in the same street.\n\nSeven men and three women were subsequently detained and remain in custody.\n\nDet Supt Figo Forouzan, from Met Police, said: \"This is a truly shocking incident that will understandably cause the community concerns.\n\n\"I want to reassure the Hounslow residents that we have commenced a thorough investigation with the support of our homicide investigation team to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe force has appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThis is the fourth time in as many months that the prime minister has met President Biden.\n\nI have been in tow each time, and it's been fascinating to get a glimpse of their growing relationship.\n\nAnd quite some growing it's had to do.\n\nWhen Rishi Sunak became prime minister", "gt": ", President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.\n\nNot long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had \"taken a bit of a knock,\" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.\n\nCore to his brand as prime minister is attempting to personify the opposite: hoping to be seen as dependable, believable, credible, trustworthy.\n\nLittle wonder, then, he ducked a question on the way here about what", "response": ", President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.\n\nNot long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had \"taken a bit of a knock,\" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.\n\nSo, stage one of the Sunak-Biden bromance was the presidential visit to Windsor for that first meeting with the King.\n\nThen came the gulf between the two men, when Mr Sunak refused to commit to the president's", "rougeL": 0.5822784810126583, "rougeL_recall": 0.5974025974025974, "rouge1": 0.6075949367088607, "rouge1_recall": 0.6233766233766234}, {"prompt": "ic and Legal Medicine says he was \"likely to have bought heroin and not known it was laced with xylazine and fentanyl\".\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first death associated with xylazine use reported in the UK, and even Europe, and indicates the entry of xylazine into the UK drug supply,\" it adds.\n\nXylazine is used by vets as a powerful sedative but it's not approved for use in humans.\n\nKnown as \"tranq\" or \"tranq dope\" when cut with heroin and fentanyl by drug dealers, xylazine has been causing huge problems in the US.\n\nIf injected directly into someone's bloodstream, it can cause large open skin ulcers to form.

Temperatures above 50C have been recorded in China and the US, where body bags filled with ice are being used to cool hospital patients. The UK has just had its hottest ever June.\n\nAnd in 2022, the UK recorded a temperature above 40C for the first time. Last year's heatwave has been blamed for 60,000 deaths across Europe.\n\nIt's no wonder the United Nations has warned we now live in the era of \"global boiling\".\n\n\"I think it's really important to realise it's no longer just something that's distant or far away from us or something in the future. We are really seeing it now,\" says Prof Lizzie Kendon from the Met Office.\n\nSo what does the changing climate mean for our bodies and our health?\n\nI tend to collapse into a sweaty puddle when it gets hot, but I've been invited to take part in a heatwave experiment.\n\nProf Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales wants to give me a typical heatwave encounter. So we're going to start at 21C, crank up the thermostat to 35C and then finally up to 40.3C - equivalent to the UK's hottest day.\n\n\"You will be sweating and your body's physiology is going to change quite considerably,\" Prof Bailey warns me.\n\nProf Bailey leads me into his environmental chamber.

They were looking for the moment when core body temperature started to rise rapidly.\n\n\"That's when it becomes dangerous. Our core temperature starts to rise and that can lead to organ failure,\" says researcher Rachel Cottle.\n\nAnd that danger point is reached at lower temperatures when the humidity is high.\n\nThe concern is that heatwaves are not only becoming more frequent, longer in duration and more severe, but they're becoming more humid too, says Cottle.\n\nShe points out that last year, India and Pakistan were hit by a severe heatwave with both critical temperatures and high humidity. \"It's definitely a 'now' problem, not a future problem,\" she says.\n\nThe human body is built to operate at a core temperature of about 37C degrees. We become more light-headed and prone to fainting as the core rises closer to 40C.\n\nHigh core temperatures damage our body's tissues, such as heart muscle and the brain. Eventually this becomes deadly.\n\n\"Once the core temperature rises to around about 41-42 degrees centigrade we start to see really, really significant problems and if not treated the individual will actually die as a result, succumbing to hyperthermia,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nPeople's ability to cope with the heat varies, but age and ill health can make us far more vulnerable, and temperatures we may have once enjoyed on holidays may be dangerous at a different stage in life.\n\n\"You're going to leave the lab today with a smile on your face - all of these statistics coming are telling me that you have risen to the challenge and you've done a jolly good job,\" says Prof Bailey\n\nBut old age, heart disease, lung disease, dementia and some medications mean the body is already working harder to keep going, and is less able to respond to the heat.\n\n\"Every day it's a physiological challenge for them, now when you throw in extra spicy heat and humidity, sometimes they can't rise to that challenge,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nMany of the tips for coping with the heat are obvious and well known - stay in the shade, wear loose fitting clothes, avoid alcohol, keep your house cool, don't exercise in the hottest parts of the day and stay hydrated (you saw how much I sweated in an hour).\n\n\"Another tip is try not to get sunburned. A mild sunburn can knock out the ability to thermoregulate or to sweat for as long as two weeks,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nBut dealing with the heat is something we could all have to become used to dealing with.\n\nWithout action on climate change Prof Lizzie Kendon said the hottest UK summer day could increase by 6C under a high-emission scenario: \"That's a huge increase by the end of the century.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Gerry Holt and Dan Welsh.\n\u2022 None The new normal - why this summer has been so very hot\n\nKing Charles has delivered a speech partly in German at Bellevue Palace in Berlin during a state visit to the country, his first since becoming monarch.\n\nThe monarch made several jokes and praised the ties between the UK and Germany.\n\nThe King and his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, attended a state banquet hosted by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nAmong those in attendance were the first lady Elke B\u00fcdenbender, as well as dignitaries from both Germany and the UK, including former Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

most Stormont departments will have their budgets cut in cash terms.\n\n\"The purpose was not to punish anybody with this budget - it's to make sure services can continue in the absence of devolved government,\" said Mr Heaton-Harris.\n\nAsked what else he could offer the DUP given that its stance on re-entering Stormont has not changed, he replied: \"Let's see where talks lead to.\"\n\nDUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had \"real concerns about the lack of allocations within the budget for pay awards\".\n\n\"There are major challenges here and we are concerned about the way the Northern Ireland Office is handling things,\" he said.\n\n\"This is what the secretary of state described as a flat budget.\n\n\"Of course I want to see Stormont back up and running but it needs to be on a stable foundation.\"\n\nHe said going back to Stormont was not a \"quick fix\".\n\nThe Department of Health, the largest department, is receiving an allocation of \u00a37.25bn for day-to-day spending - similar to the amount it got last year.\n\nThis \"flat cash\" funding will likely be viewed as a difficult settlement for the department, given the current high rate of inflation and outstanding pay demands.\n\nCompared with last year's budget figures the amount of money going to Education, Justice and Economy - the biggest spending departments - has been cut slightly in cash terms.\n\nEducation will get \u00a32.57bn, down from \u00a32.64bn, Justice will get \u00a31.12bn, down from \u00a31.14bn, while Economy will get \u00a3772m, down from \u00a3780m.\n\nThis budget could have been worse. But make no mistake, it is still likely to mean deteriorating public services for NI citizens.\n\nThe blow has been softened a little by allowing last year's \u00a3300m overspend to be repaid over two years instead of one.\n\nThe repayments will be drawn from any new money sent from Westminster later this year rather than being immediately chopped from departmental funds.\n\nBut that will present a significant challenge to the senior civil servants currently running Stormont.\n\nThere is an expectation that the UK government will eventually provide extra money to settle public sector pay disputes in England.\n\nThat will automatically mean extra funding for Stormont.\n\nBut that raises the prospect that the senior officials will then have to tell their workforces that they will not get a pay deal to match England because the", "gt": "overspend comes first.\n\nThat is not a recipe for industrial peace.\n\nRead more from John here.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the overspend would be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury.\n\nShould this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages.\n\nIt is understood that the possibility of drawing on a funding stream known as financial transactions capital (FTC) is being considered.\n", "response": "overspend comes first.\n\nThat is not a recipe for industrial peace.\n\nOn Thursday, the head of the civil service, Jayne Brady, warned that the public service was facing a \"very difficult\" year ahead.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, she said the impact of the flat budget would be felt across all sectors.\n\n\"We're working very hard to try and mitigate the impacts of the decisions that we've had to take,\" she said.\n\n\"We're in a very difficult position and we're having", "rougeL": 0.23952095808383234, "rougeL_recall": 0.24390243902439024, "rouge1": 0.29940119760479045, "rouge1_recall": 0.3048780487804878}, {"prompt": "yley told a local news website \"I've had enough\"\n\nTwo former pub managers have given a voluntary interview to Essex Police after their collection of golly dolls was seized by the force.\n\nFive officers removed the offensive dolls from the White Hart Inn in Grays, which has since shut down, following a hate crime allegation.\n\nEssex Police was waiting for landlord Chris Ryley to return from abroad and it confirmed he and wife Benice Ryley were spoken to on Thursday.\n\nA police spokesperson said: \"Two people, a man and woman, have been interviewed voluntarily as part of our investigation.\n\nThe police seized the dolls from behind the bar on 4 April and the Campaign for Real Ale removed the pub from its Good Beer Guide the following week.\n\nMrs Ryley said at the time she had displayed the collection, donated by her late aunt and customers, for nearly 10 years.\n\nThe building was vandalised with white paint and had its windows damaged on 16 April - prompting a separate police investigation.\n\nMrs Ryley closed the pub on 1 May, citing a boycott by brewing companies and the maintenance firm Innserve.\n\nHeineken and Carlsberg both told the couple to stop serving its lager, with Heineken labelling the collection as an \"abhorrent display\".\n\nAdmiral Taverns, the company that owned the pub building, said it planned to reopen the venue under new management.\n\nThe dolls are thought to date back to the minstrel entertainment shows, when typically white actors painted their faces black and depicted negative stereotypes of black people.\n\nIt became a fictional character that appeared in books by Florence Kate Upton in the late 19th Century.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.\n\nSuffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.\n\nIt was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.\n\nThe Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.\n\nPavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.\n\nUnlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\n\n\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"\n\nI couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive\n\nIt was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.\n\nTsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.\n\nTwo minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.\n\nAt that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.\n\nThe 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\n\n\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\n\n\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover.

That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.\n\nThe new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.\n\nThe investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.\n\nModern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.\n\nThey were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.\n\nThe NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.\n\n\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"\n\nBut she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"\n\nThere has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway.\n\n\"We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,\" the memo says.\n\nSome of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.\n\nPfizer", "gt": "no longer produces sertraline.

That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show.\n\nThe new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason.\n\nThe investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.\n\nModern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.\n\nThey were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.\n\nThe NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication.\n\n\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\n\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"\n\nBut she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"\n\nThere has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term.\n\nBut on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.\n\nAnd there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.\n\nWithdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to.\n\nTaking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.\n\nThe symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you", "gt": "can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what", "response": "can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line.\n\nPanorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.\n\nA copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what", "rougeL": 1.0, "rougeL_recall": 1.0, "rouge1": 1.0, "rouge1_recall": 1.0}, {"prompt": "doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.\n\n\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\"\n\nThe companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.\n\nThey said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information.

But in the summer of 2022 he moved to then-occupied parts of Ukraine, making the southern city of Kherson his base.\n\nHis main task was to set up pro-Russian television stations in regions captured since the start of the full-scale invasion. He has masterminded Tavria TV in Kherson, Za TV in Melitopol and Mariupol 24 in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nAlexander Malkevich (right) has recruited underage reporters for his propaganda channels\n\nThe channels' reporting strictly follows the Kremlin's propaganda narratives. For example, a recent programme aired by Tavria TV reminded its viewers of the reasons given by Moscow to justify its war against Ukraine. \"Russian President Vladimir Putin says the special military operation was a forced step, because Moscow had been left with no other choice. Such security risks had been created for Russia that no other reaction was possible,\" it said.\n\nOne major obstacle facing Malkevich was an acute shortage of people willing and able to work for his channels.\n\nTo train staff, he opened a \"media school\" in Kherson, became head of the journalism department at the local university and authored a textbook for aspiring media workers in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, called \"Real Russian journalism for new regions\".\n\nSome of his students joined his TV stations before becoming legally adults. Two reporters who started working for Za TV and Tavria TV respectively were both employed at the age of just 16. The BBC has chosen not to identify the two girls because of their age.\n\nOne of the teens is known as \"Russia's youngest war reporter\" and got an award from President Vladimir Putin\n\nBut Malkevich's stint in Kherson was short-lived. Shortly before the city was retaken by Ukrainian forces in November, he fled along with some equipment and staff. While evacuating, they came under fire, and one staff member (a Russian journalist and former FSB operative) was killed.\n\nOne of the teen reporters was wounded during the shelling, and was later presented with an Order of Bravery by President Putin at a ceremony in the Kremlin.\n\nMalkevich first rose", "gt": "to relative prominence in 2018, when he launched USA Really - a website set up in the US by RIA FAN, which, in turn, is the most prominent outlet in the stable of propaganda and disinformation media associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner head once dubbed \"Putin's chef\" because he supplied food to the Kremlin.\n\nPRIGOZHIN: From Putin's chef to head of Russia's private army\n\nRIA FAN grew out of Prigozhin's infamous", "response": "to prominence in 2015, when he was identified as the mastermind behind a social media campaign to discredit a Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny.\n\nHe was sanctioned by the US in 2015 and by the EU in 2017 for spreading disinformation and undermining democracy.\n\nHe is also known for his links to the notorious \"troll factory\" in St Petersburg, which was accused of meddling in the 2016 US election.\n\nHe has also been linked to the \"chef\"", "rougeL": 0.25, "rougeL_recall": 0.25333333333333335, "rouge1": 0.34210526315789475, "rouge1_recall": 0.3466666666666667}, {"prompt": "rip and will face the consequences of security violations against Israel\".\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Hamas described a car-ramming and stabbing attack in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv as a \"natural response\" to the Jenin operation.\n\nIsraeli authorities said seven people were injured on a busy shopping street and that the attacker was a Palestinian man from the West Bank.

The health ministry has said more than 140 Palestinians have been injured, 30 of them critically.\n\nA Palestinian Red Crescent official said about 3,000 Palestinians, including many sick and elderly, were allowed overnight to flee the drone strikes and gun battles between Israeli troops and armed Palestinians.\n\nA man in a wheelchair who was escorted out of the camp with his family in the morning told the BBC that they had been held in a room by Israeli troops.\n\n\"We were encircled by a military barricade.

He is a publicity seeker who has not followed through on previous threats.\n\nRussian troops and fighters from Wagner, a private military company, have been trying to capture Bakhmut for months - despite its questionable strategic value.\n\nWestern officials believe thousands of Russian and Wagner troops have been killed in the fighting, and the eastern Ukrainian city has become a symbolic prize.\n\nYet - although Russian troops and Wagner fighters are on the same side - it is an uneasy alliance.\n\nPrigozhin has regularly criticised Russian officials for what he claims is a lack of front-line support.\n\nIn his new statement, Prigozhin claimed that Gen Sergei Surovikin - who commanded Russia's forces in Ukraine between October and January - had been appointed to liaise between Russia's regular military and Wagner mercenaries.\n\n\"This is the only man with the star of an army general who knows how to fight,\" Prigozhin said. \"No other army general is reasonable.\"\n\nWhile Prigozhin didn't expressly reverse his pledge to withdraw troops from Bakhmut, he said his forces had been given permission to \"act in Bakhmut as we see fit\" - appearing to suggest they will remain.\n\nThe Kremlin has not commented on Prigozhin's latest statement.\n\nWagner has its own set of commanders, objectives and motivations, and Prigozhin is widely believed to hold his own domestic political ambitions.\n\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov have often been the focus for his anger, amid reports of infighting among different power groups in Vladimir Putin's entourage.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday, Prigozhin raged: \"Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the... ammunition?... They came here as volunteers and die for you to fatten yourselves in your mahogany offices.\"\n\nAnd he said Wagner's casualties were \"growing in geometrical progression every day\" because of the lack of ammunition.\n\nAt the time, Ukrainian officials expressed scepticism that Prigozhin truly intended to withdraw his forces from Bakhmut.\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Friday that Wagner was actually redeploying mercenaries towards Bakhmut in a bid to capture the city before T", "gt": "uesday's Victory Day celebrations in Russia.\n\nIn other developments in Ukraine and Russia:\n\nThese buildings in Bakhmut are amongst the thousands destroyed across Ukraine as a result of the war with Russia\n\nUkraine's economy will need external help for many years to come, a senior World Bank official has told the BBC.\n\nThe war-torn country \"also has a lot of potential to turn a lot of its assets into economic opportunity and recovery\", according to Anna Bjerde.\n\nThe managing director for operations was talking before a major international conference in", "response": "uesday's celebrations of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.\n\n\"The enemy is trying to take Bakhmut by Tuesday, May 9, before the celebrations,\" Ms Maliar wrote on Telegram. \"Probably so that no-one can celebrate Victory Day in Bakhmut.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Friday that Wagner was \"likely redeploying some of its forces to Bakhmut in an attempt to capture", "rougeL": 0.16853932584269662, "rougeL_recall": 0.16129032258064516, "rouge1": 0.29213483146067415, "rouge1_recall": 0.27956989247311825}, {"prompt": "the BBC that \"the majority of businesses in Ukraine don't plan to make claims for war damages until proper and clear compensation mechanisms are developed and eventually implemented\".\n\nCoca-Cola's factory in Kyiv was damaged early in the war but has since been reopened\n\nThe two-day meeting of business leaders and politicians will also look at if a war insurance scheme can be put into place to encourage some of the private sector investment that the World Bank says is vital to rebuilding the economy.\n\nIn a separate survey it found firms have seen an average 53% drop in sales compared with pre-war 2021.

Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. \"We will still liberate all our land,\" he said in a video address.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue.\n\nAn aerial image shows water pouring through what appears to be a breach in the dam\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the \"epicentre of hostilities\" in Bakhmut, but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun.\n\nBakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting.

The standing ovation for reaching his first Test half-century in four years recognised Moeen's selfless service this summer. He was unlucky that a full-blooded pull off Starc was sharply taken by Usman Khawaja.\n\nRoot arrived with the score at 130-2 and the game in the balance, but was instantly at his impish, imperious best.\n\nHe dealt with Australia's short-ball plan by expertly executing hooks and pulls. His intent to score brought 40 off his first 30 balls - Root's fastest-ever start to a Test innings. He played his trademark reverse-scoops off Mitchell Marsh and Cummins.\n\nRoot deserved a century of his own, only to be bowled by a scuttler from Hazlewood - keeping even lower than the one that got Crawley.\n\nThe way in which Brook and Stokes calmly played for the morning is ominous for the Australians. The sight of 'nighthawk' Stuart Broad padded up late in the day was a sign of England's intent.\n\nEngland opener Zak Crawley, speaking to Test Match Special: \"I rode my luck at times and played some really good parts in the innings and there were other parts where I was really streaky but I'm happy with how I have played.

He was not voicing frustration or anger. He was instead suggesting Kyiv needed to be more politically savvy. He was saying Ukrainian officials should understand more about the internal politics of their allies, particularly the United States. They should not be surprised, he suggested, there were a few \u201cgrumbles\u201d on Capitol Hill if they turned up in Washington with a shopping list of weapons, as if the US government were like a branch of Amazon. They should understand, Wallace said, they were asking some countries to give up the bulk of their ammunition stocks. So Wallace\u2019s remarks were like a parent telling a child to remember to write a thank-you letter to a relative so they get a present next year too. It might not have been very diplomatic for him to say this in the middle of a summit designed to emphasise Nato unity. But Wallace is known for his outspoken support for Ukraine and his efforts to send Western military arms and ammunition to the country - so he will probably be forgiven for his frankness, which will come as no surprise to Britain\u2019s allies.\n\nSir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic rocket plane is back in action after a gap of almost two years.\n\nThe Unity vehicle, with two pilots and four passengers aboard, climbed high over the New Mexico desert to the edge of space - before gliding back down.\n\nIt was billed as the plane's final test outing before entering commercial service in June.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe shooter who killed six people at a school in Nashville, Tennessee, on Monday bought seven guns legally and hid them at home, police say.\n\nInvestigators say the suspect's parents felt the 28-year-old should not own weapons, and did not realise the guns had been concealed in their house.\n\nSix people, including three children age nine, were killed in the attack at the Covenant School.\n", "gt": "\nThe suspect was under \"doctor's care for an emotional disorder\", police say.\n\nThey believe it was the school that was targeted rather than any particular individual but have not indicated any motive.\n\nTennessee has no laws that allow police to seize guns from violent suspects.\n\nDespite the absence of such so-called red-flag laws, police said they would still have sought to have the weapons confiscated if authorities had had any warning that the suspect could have posed a threat.\n\nThe pupils killed in the attack were Evelyn Die", "response": "\nThe suspect, who is now dead, had a previous conviction for attempted burglary.\n\nHe was under \"doctor's care for an emotional disorder\", police say.\n\nThe attack was America's 16th mass shooting so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines such incidents as four people injured or killed.", "rougeL": 0.2638888888888889, "rougeL_recall": 0.2087912087912088, "rouge1": 0.3194444444444445, "rouge1_recall": 0.25274725274725274}, {"prompt": ".\n\nThere have been 15 mass shootings at schools or universities in the US since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, according to a database maintained by the Associated Press.\n\nWe're wrapping up our live page shortly.

SAS killings in Afghanistan: The story of one suspicious death\n\nIn 2019, the BBC and the Sunday Times investigated one SAS raid which led to a UK court case and an order to the UK defence minister to disclose documents outlining the government's handling of the case.\n\nFor this latest investigation, the BBC analysed newly obtained operational reports detailing the SAS's accounts of night raids. We found a pattern of strikingly similar reports of Afghan men being shot dead because they pulled AK-47 rifles or hand grenades from behind curtains or other furniture after having been detained.\n\nThe total death toll during the squadron's six-month tour was in the triple figures. No injuries to SAS operatives were reported across all the raids scrutinised by the BBC.\n\nA senior officer who worked at UK Special Forces headquarters told the BBC there was \"real concern\" over the squadron's reports.\n\n\"Too many people were being killed on night raids and the explanations didn't make sense,\" he said. \"Once somebody is detained, they shouldn't end up dead. For it to happen over and over again was causing alarm at HQ.", "gt": "It was clear at the time that something was wrong.\"\n\nInternal emails from the time show that officers reacted with disbelief to the reports, describing them as \"quite incredible\" and referring to the squadron's \"latest massacre\". An operations officer emailed a colleague to say that \"for what must be the 10th time in the last two weeks\" the squadron had sent a detainee back into a building \"and he reappeared with an AK\".\n\n\"Then when they walked back in to a different A [building] with another B [", "response": "It was clear something was wrong.\"\n\nThe officer said he was so concerned about the squadron's reports that he took the rare step of contacting the head of UK Special Forces, General Carleton-Smith, to raise his concerns.\n\nGeneral Carleton-Smith was head of UK Special Forces when the squadron was deployed to Afghanistan\n\nThe senior officer said he was \"shocked\" when he was told that General Carleton-Smith had been briefed about the suspicious deaths but had not passed on the concerns to the military police.\n\n\"I was told he'd been brief", "rougeL": 0.19672131147540983, "rougeL_recall": 0.20454545454545456, "rouge1": 0.28415300546448086, "rouge1_recall": 0.29545454545454547}, {"prompt": "one male back inside to assist special forces operatives with a search.\n\nBut senior officers became concerned by the frequency with which the squadron's own accounts described detainees being taken back inside buildings and then grabbing for hidden weapons - an enemy tactic not reported by other British military forces operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThere were also concerns among officers that on a significant number of raids, there were more people killed than weapons reportedly recovered from the scene - suggesting the SAS was shooting unarmed people - and that SAS operatives might be falsifying evidence by dropping weapons at scenes after killing people.\n\nAfter similar concerns were raised in Australia, a judge-led inquiry was commissioned and found \"credible evidence\" members of Australian Special Forces were responsible for the unlawful killing 39 people, and used 'drop weapons' in an attempt to justify shootings.\n\nBy April 2011, the concerns were so great in the UK that a senior special forces officer wrote to the director of special forces warning that there was evidence of \"deliberate killing of individuals after they have been restrained\" and \"fabrication of evidence to suggest a lawful killing in self-defence\".\n\nTwo days later, the UK Special Forces assistant chief of staff warned the director that the SAS could be operating a policy to \"kill fighting-aged males on target even when they did not pose a threat.\"\n\nIf the suspicions were true, he wrote, the SAS squadron had \"strayed into indefensible ethical and legal behaviour\".\n\nThe SAS squadron operated in some of the most dangerous areas in southern Afghanistan, often raiding residential compounds in villages\n\nThe BBC visited several of the homes raided by the SAS squadron in 2010/11. At one, in a small village in Nad Ali in Helmand, there was a bricked up guesthouse where nine Afghan men including a teenager were killed in the early hours of 7 February 2011.\n\nThe SAS operatives arrived in helicopters under the cover of darkness and approached the house from a nearby field. According to their account, insurgents opened fire at them, prompting them to shoot back and kill everyone in the guesthouse.\n\nOnly three AK-47s were recovered, according to the SAS account - one of at least six raids by the squadron on which the reported number of enemy weapons was fewer than the number of people killed.\n\nInside the guesthouse, what appeared to be bullet holes from the raid were clustered together on the walls low to the ground. The BBC showed photographs from the scene to ballistics experts, who said that the clusters suggested multiple rounds had been fired downward from above, and did not appear indicative of a firefight.\n\nLeigh Neville, an expert on weapons used by UK Special Forces, said the bullet patterns suggested that \"targets were low to the ground, either prone or in a sitting or crouching position close to the wall - an unusual position if they were actively involved in a firefight\".\n\nThe same pattern was visible at two other locations examined by the BBC. Ballistics experts who reviewed images said the bullet holes were suggestive of execution-style killings rather than firefights.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an RMP investigator confirmed to the BBC that they had seen photographs from the scenes and that the bullet mark patterns had raised alarm.\n\n\"You can see why we were concerned,\" the investigator said. \"Bullet marks on the walls so low to the ground appeared to undermine the special forces' version of events.\"\n\nIn 2014, the RMP launched Operation Northmoor, a wide-ranging investigation into more than 600 alleged offences by British forces in Afghanistan, including a number of killings by the SAS squadron. But RMP investigators told the BBC that they were obstructed by British military in their efforts to gather evidence.\n\nOperation Northmoor was wound down in 2017 and eventually closed in 2019. The Ministry of Defence has said that no evidence of criminality was found. Members of the investigations team told the BBC they dispute that conclusion.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said British troops were held to the highest standards. \"No new evidence has been presented, but the Service Police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a further statement, the MoD said it believed Panorama had jumped to \"unjustified conclusions from allegations that have already", "gt": "been fully investigated\".\n\nIt said: \"We have provided a detailed and comprehensive statement to Panorama, highlighting unequivocally how two Service Police operations carried out extensive and independent investigation into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Neither investigation found sufficient evidence to prosecute.

BBC Wales environment correspondent Steffan Messenger explains why Ffos-y-Fran is closing and what happens next\n\nThe UK's last opencast coalmine has closed as fears mount over whether the massive site will be restored.\n\nDocuments seen by BBC News show concerns at the Welsh government and UK Coal Authority that Merthyr Tydfil's Ffos-y-Fran mine may be abandoned.\n\nEstimated clean-up costs for the site - the size of 400 football pitches - have grown to between \u00a3120m and \u00a3175m.\n\nSite operator Merthyr (South Wales) Ltd said it was in \"constructive dialogue\" with Merthyr Tydfil council.\n\nUnion Unite, which represents 115 workers being made redundant as coal mining stops, said it understood the company was \"committed\" to restoring the site in future and would not walk away.\n\nWelsh mountain pony breeder Roy Thomas, 80, who lives metres from the mine's boundary, called it \"a total blight\" on his life for the past 16 years and described the mine as a \"neighbour from hell\".\n\nThe Welsh government allowed the controversial project to happen close to homes and businesses because it is a \"land reclamation scheme\" that requires the operator to return it to green hillside, with most of that work due to happen after mining had stopped.\n\nToday a giant pit - which is about 656ft (200m) deep - remains.\n\nA large black hole remains at Ffos-y-Fran, visible from parts of Merthyr Tydfil and the A465 Heads of the Valley road\n\nMr Thomas described the scene as \"absolutely disgusting\", adding that the mounds of spoil material should go back in the hole as there is \"millions of tonnes of material in there\".\n\nFfos-y-Fran has produced nearly 11.25m tonnes of coal since opening in 2008, and is responsible for 86% of the UK's total coal output.\n\nSince September 2022, its owners have been digging without planning permission - an application for more time was refused and the firm appealed an enforcement notice before announcing a closure date of 30 November.\n\nNegotiations between the firm and the council continue over what happens next.\n\nThe company has admitted \"insufficient funds\" had been set aside to carry out the agreed restoration work.\n\nIn a letter released under the Freedom of Information Act to campaign group Coal Action Network and shared with BBC News, the UK Coal Authority's chief executive criticised the council's approach.\n\nWriting to the Welsh government on 20 October, Lisa Pinney said there had been \"very little visible progress\" in preparing for the mine's closure and \"no agreed revised restoration plan or emergency response plan in place if the site should be abandoned\".\n\nHow to", "gt": "manage rising water levels is one issue yet to be resolved, with Ms Pinney writing that, without a clear plan, \"there is a clear risk to public safety and to the environment\".\n\nAnother document released to the campaigners reveals advice for climate change minister Julie James.\n\nThe heavily redacted document, also sent to First Minister Mark Drakeford, said \"officials consider the company is likely to seek administration\" after coal mining stops.\n\nAlternatively \"they may seek to continue to restore the site\", as long as they can draw down money from a \u00a31", "response": "manage rising temperatures is a major issue for the Welsh government, which has ambitious targets to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nNet zero means no more greenhouse gas would be added to the atmosphere.\n\nClimate Change Minister Julie James said the Welsh government was working with the local authority and other partners to \"put in place a revised restoration plan that will see the site returned to green hillside as soon as possible\".\n\nShe added: \"I've been clear that we need to go further and faster to tackle climate change and reach our ambitious", "rougeL": 0.21390374331550804, "rougeL_recall": 0.21739130434782608, "rouge1": 0.35294117647058826, "rouge1_recall": 0.358695652173913}, {"prompt": "He called me right back and we sent him a script,\" says George. \"That started the ball rolling.\"\n\nMark ended up curating the soundtrack, writing the score and penning the film's closing song, Dance the Night Away, with Dua Lipa.\n\nDolly Chartin': Dua Lipa's song Dance the Night Away was the first song from the soundtrack to be released\n\nThe soundtrack's also played a big part in Barbie's massive marketing campaign.\n\nSongs from the 17-track album have been steadily released in the run-up to the film's release, which George says has \"helped fuel excitement for the movie\".\n\n\"It was a perfect symbiotic relationship of the music driving the movie and the movie driving the music,\" he says.\n\n\"Once you saw the movie and how well the music works, as soon as they left the theatre people went out and got the album.\"\n\nAnd, this being Barbie, physical copies of the soundtrack are available in \"cotton candy\" vinyl and on transparent pink cassette tapes.\n\nNicki Minaj collaborated with Ice Spice to release Barbie World, which has been streamed more than 42m times on YouTube\n\nGeorge refuses to reveal his favourite track but says he was \"blown away\" by Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For.\n\nHe says the singer was shown just 25 minutes of the film and managed to \"take what she'd seen and encapsulate it into this heartbreaking song of being a woman\".\n\nGeorge says he's very proud of the album and its success in the charts is \"the icing on the cake\".\n\n\"It's Barbie's world, we just live in it,\" he says.\n\nAqua's Barbie Girl, sampled in Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice's movie song, also returned to the chart for the first time since its original release in 1997.\n\nAnd while plastic sure is fantastic, Dave and Central Cee kept the top spot, with Sprinter entering its eighth week at number one.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo also sunk her teeth deeper into the number two slot, holding firm with Vampire.\n\nAs recently as 2018, The Greatest Showman soundtrack sold 2.1m copies in the UK, outpacing new releases by Drake and Ariana Grande.\n\nBut the idea of chart-topping artists working together on a blockbuster movie had largely fallen out of favour in the era of superhero franchises and cinematic universes.\n\nEven before that, young adult movies like Twilight and Hunger Games were aligning themselves with credible alternative artists like Paramore, Iron & Wine and The National. Lorde even curated the (superb) music for Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Pt 1.\n\nOver the last few years, there have been flickers of the traditional soundtrack album returning.

Here's how the drama is playing out on Capitol Hill and a guide to what comes next.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, President Joe Biden and Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy finally reached a deal to raise the amount of money the US can borrow, avoid a default on the national debt, and limit federal spending for the next two years.\n\nNow the pair are busy selling their weekend agreement to Congress. First up is the US House of Representatives, which is scheduled to hold a vote on the agreement on Wednesday evening. Republican and Democratic leaders there believe that even with some defections on the left and right, they have the votes to pass a bill - perhaps by a comfortable margin.\n\nThe legislation then moves to the Senate, which will pose new challenges to the agreement. Unlike the Republican-majority House, Democrats control the upper chamber with 51 out of its 100 seats. According to parliamentary rules, 60 votes are required to approve most bills - so some combination of Democratic and Republican votes will be needed.\n\nThose rules also offer individual senators broad powers to slow consideration of legislation for days. With the date when the US will hit its borrowing limit estimated by the US Treasury to be Monday 5 June, that leaves little margin for error or delay.\n\nOne conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, has threatened to use \"every procedural tool\" to slow consideration of the deal. He, and other recalcitrant Republicans, may be mollified if Senate leadership allows the chamber to vote on changes to the deal.\n\nIf any of those changes are approved, however, it could threaten the carefully negotiated balance in the legislation and would almost certainly push final approval past 5 June.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom.\n\nAnd it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\".\n\nShell said last year it would close all its service stations in Russia\n\nSince then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east.\n\nShell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin.\n\nBut it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nNovatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\"\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.\n\n\"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies.

This means many dentists are operating at a loss.\n\nThe BDA has asked the Scottish government to bring payment reform forward.\n\nMs Waite said: \"If they don't sort out and reform the funding of this system there is a real risk that they will lose even more dentists from the NHS service.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said NHS Highland had now received expressions of interest for opening new dental practices, and the government would work with the health board to provide funding support if the applications were successful.\n\nThe government is also continuing to work \"apace\" on payment reform.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThe Ireland women's rugby team has chosen to swap their traditional white shorts and make a permanent switch to navy because of period concerns.\n\nThe move comes as a response to feedback from players about playing in white rugby kit during their period.\n\nThe new Ireland kit will be seen for the first time at the Women's Six Nations launch in London on Wednesday and throughout the tournament.\n\nIreland will begin their campaign against Wales on Saturday 25 March.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster in January, Gillian McDarby, the head of Women's Performance at IRFU, said the organisation were in talks about the change with kit supplier Canterbury of New Zeland after consulting the players.\n\nThey say they will give other rugby players and teams at all levels who have purchased white women's Canterbury shorts the opportunity to claim a free pair in a different colour.\n\nIreland International Enya Breen, said: \"The top way to ensure we perform to our best on the field is by removing any unnecessary distractions.

Though Labuschagne took a painful blow on the finger from a Wood bouncer, he was largely untroubled by England's short-ball plan.\n\nMarsh, usually so aggressive, was a calm foil. He has struck only four fours in a 107-ball stay and two of those came in successive deliveries from Chris Woakes, who spent time off the field suffering from stiffness.\n\nWhen Root came on, Labuschagne lofted two sixes over long-on, but also flashed an edge off an arm-ball past slip Zak Crawley when he was on 93.\n\nHe went to his 11th Test ton by pinching a single off Moeen Ali before making an error attempting to cut Root and was given out on review.\n\nGiven the stakes and urgency of the situation, this was a curiously flat performance from England's seamers.\n\nThey got little movement from the ball or the pitch and chewed up precious time as they deliberated over field placings and tactics.\n\nA bouncer plan achieved little other than knocking the ball out of shape, after which came the stroke of luck with Wood being denied the chance to bowl, resulting in the call to Moeen and Root.\n\nWhile Moeen mixed some dangerous bounce with regular loose deliveries, Root constantly made things happen.\n\nHe was convinced on-field umpire Nitin Menon had made a mistake for the Labuschagne wicket, celebrating towards the Party Stand even before the review was complete. In the same over, an inside edge off Marsh went in and out of the fingers of bat-pad fielder Harry Brook.\n\nGreen survived a review off Moeen from the final ball before the tea break.

The computer systems on board - such as the avionics - operate in a very different way to Soviet aircraft.\n\nIn combat, pilots need to instinctively select multiple, correct modes in complex scenarios where they are at risk of being overwhelmed by rapidly developing events - a situation known as task-saturation.\n\nImagine as a car driver switching from a Renault to a Mercedes, and having to instantly know the position of the headlight switches, the wipers and the fog lights - all on a hugely more complicated level. It takes time and practice.\n\nUkrainian pilots will receive training on bespoke simulators. But it is also highly likely they would have been practising on commercially available software, which delivers a very close representation of the workflow required to operate an F-16.\n\nNumbers are also key. It is little use sending half a dozen jets which on their own might be vulnerable to the mighty Su-35s operated by Russia.\n\nCombat aircraft are most effective in packages where jets are grouped together for certain roles - all to carry out one specific mission.\n\nFor example, if the mission is to neutralise an enemy radar installation, you might want a \"four-ship\" comprising four jets to carry the missiles or the bombs to destroy that structure.\n\nThat role is called a Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) strike.", "gt": "But you do not want that critical flight itself to be vulnerable to attack.\n\nSo you might have another four aircraft flying ahead in a \"SEAD escort\" role, armed with air-to-air weapons, to protect the SEAD strike from enemy planes.\n\nThe point is all this requires many aircraft, and they need to be supported by other assets.\n\nThat would include surveillance planes to warn about enemy fighters in the area, ground maintenance crews to ensure the upkeep of the jets and having, of course, the necessary infrastructure to take off and land", "response": "\n\nYou would then have a second \"four-ship\" to provide cover, and perhaps an additional two aircraft to act as an early warning aircraft or a command and control plane.\n\nThe point is that you need a lot of aircraft to provide the necessary air cover for your own forces.\n\nThe US decision to allow allies to supply F-16s to Ukraine is a positive move.

She had no money, and could not see a", "response": "scratch, they are still living in fear.\n\n\"I'm still scared of being caught,\" Songmi says. \"I'm scared of being sent back to North Korea.\"\n\nTheir fears are not unfounded.\n\nIn 2022, the UN Commission of Inquiry on North Korea reported that the country had committed a \"systemic pattern of serious human rights violations\" against its own people.\n\nThe report found that the North Korean government was committing \"serious human rights violations in the context of a system of government that is fundamentally oppress", "rougeL": 0.1005586592178771, "rougeL_recall": 0.09574468085106383, "rouge1": 0.18994413407821228, "rouge1_recall": 0.18085106382978725}, {"prompt": "been executed,\" Songmi says.\n\nSongmi's account tallies with recent reports from North Korea of people being executed for distributing foreign shows.\n\n\"It seems the situation is even scarier than when I was there. People are being shot or sent to camps for having South Korean media, regardless of their age,\" she says.\n\nAdjusting to life in capitalist, free-wheeling South Korea is often a struggle for North Koreans. It is alienatingly different to anything they have experienced. But Songmi is taking it remarkably in her stride.\n\nShe misses her friends, who she could not tell she was leaving. She misses dancing with them, and the games they used to play with rocks in the dirt.\n\n\"When you meet friends in South Korea you just go shopping or drink coffee,\" she says, a little disparagingly.\n\nWhat has helped Songmi to integrate is her steadfast belief that she is no different to her South Korean peers.\n\n\"After travelling for months through China and Laos, I felt as though I was an orphan, being sent off to live in a foreign country,\" she says. But when she landed at the airport in Seoul the ground staff greeted her with a familiar \"an-nyeong-ha-say-yo\".\n\nThe word for hello, used in both North and South Korea, blew her away: \"I realised we are the same people in the same land. I hadn't come to a different country. I had just travelled south.\"\n\nShe sat in the airport and cried for 10 minutes.\n\nSongmi says she has now found her purpose - to advocate for the two Koreas to be reunited. This is the future that South Koreans are told to dream of, but many do not buy into the dream. The more time passes since the country was divided, the fewer people, particularly the young, see the need for it to come back together.\n\nSongmi visits schools to teach students about the North. She asks who among them has thought about reunification, and typically only a few hands go up. But when she asks them to draw a map of Korea, most sketch the outline of the entire peninsula, including the North and South. This gives her hope.\n\nAs Songmi settles into her relationship with her mother, there are only small glimpses of strain. The pair frequently laugh and hug, and Songmi dries her mother's tears as they explore the painful details of each other's past.\n\nHer mother's choice was the right one, Songmi says, because they are both now living happily in South Korea.\n\nMyung-hui may not have been able to recognise her daughter initially, but the pair look strikingly alike. Now she can see her 19-year-old self in her daughter.\n\nTheir relationship is more like a friendship or one of sisters. Songmi enjoys telling Myung-hui all the details of her dates.\n\nIt is only when they argue that it hits her.\n\n\"Then I'm like, wow, I really am living with my mother,\" she says, laughing.\n\nAtaf Nabhan was told he had five minutes to evacuate his house - before a missile blew it apart\n\nKamal Nabhan was screaming as he thrust the phone into his cousin's hands, unable to believe what the anonymous caller was telling him.\n\nThe men had just got ready to go to afternoon prayers in Jabalia refugee camp.

How the Royal children enjoyed the Coronation\n\nThe prospect of a two-hour church service, full of ceremony and importance, is a daunting prospect for most, let alone if you've just turned five.\n\nBut luckily for Prince Louis, the youngest royal at the Coronation had his sister Princess Charlotte to hold his hand, physically and metaphorically.\n\nTheir older brother Prince George had a formal part to play as one of their grandfather King Charles' pages of honour.\n\nBut Louis and Charlotte ended up taking a starring role too thanks to their antics during the day.\n\nThey arrived with their parents the Prince and Princess of Wales, with Charlotte in a matching Alexander McQueen outfit to her mother, down to a miniature version of Catherine's silver leaf headdress.\n\nLouis, meanwhile, wore a dark blue tunic by Savile Row tailors Dege and Skinner.\n\nPerhaps offering reassurance, or making sure he went the right way, eight-year-old Charlotte held Louis' hand as they processed through the abbey behind their parents.\n\nOnce the Coronation proper started, they took their front row seats alongside their parents. The solemn, religious ceremony elicited a yawn or two from the young prince - and he could also at times be seen pointing things out to Charlotte from their seats near the high altar.\n\nHis age is no doubt why a break was arranged, with viewers noticing Louis had disappeared from his seat, returning in time to sing God Save the King.\n\nHe had not attended the last major royal event, the funeral of his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II in September, when he was just four, as he was felt to be too young.\n\nThe siblings followed along with the order of service during the Coronation\n\nBut that wasn't enough to stop Louis from yawning during the two-hour event\n\nAfter the King was crowned and the formal part of the day was over, the Wales family met up with Prince George as he completed his duties.\n\nThey took their places in the royal procession to Buckingham Palace, in the first carriage behind the Gold State Coach.\n\nLouis pressed his face close to the glass on one side of the bench, sat opposite his parents, as he waved at the waiting crowds.\n\nLouis gave the crowds a smile and a wave as they made their way to Buckingham Palace\n\nLouis made headlines himself at last summer's Jubilee celebrations when he was seen pulling faces on the Buckingham Palace balcony and appearing to scream when the flypast went overhead.\n\nAnyone hoping for similar scenes after the Coronation would not have been disappointed.\n\nHe drummed his fingers on the balcony railing at one point, and showed his own version of the royal wave.\n\nThe two-handed wave, not dissimilar to the motion of windscreen wipers, was perhaps apt for a rainy day.\n\nThe children were seen pointing at the sky during the flypast before returning inside the palace after their long day.\n\nPoultry and captive birds can be kept outside again starting next week as the risk from bird flu eases, the government said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Chief Veterinary Officer said the \"mandatory housing order\" for England and Wales would lift at 00:01 on Tuesday, April 18.\n\nThe measures were introduced during the world's biggest ever bird flu outbreak.\n\nThe UK has seen more than 330 cases confirmed and 4 million birds culled over the past year.\n\nThe decision means that eggs laid by hens with access to outdoor areas can be marketed as \"free-range", "gt": "\" again.\n\nThe UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Christine Middlemiss, still warned that \"scrupulous standards\" of biosecurity will need to be maintained as avian flu is expected to still be circulating in the environment for several weeks.\n\nMs Middlemiss said: \"Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news... the unprecedented nature of this outbreak has proved it's more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant.\"\n\nFigures released to the BBC showed that ", "response": "\" again.\n\nThe British Free Range Egg Producers Association (Bfrepa) said the lifting of the housing order would mean that \"free-range, organic and free-range organic egg producers can once again give their hens access to outdoor areas\".\n\nThe association's chief executive Robert Gooch said: \"Free-range egg producers will be relieved to see their hens outside again and we look forward to the warmer weather so they can enjoy the outdoors.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "rougeL": 0.17177914110429446, "rougeL_recall": 0.17721518987341772, "rouge1": 0.28220858895705525, "rouge1_recall": 0.2911392405063291}, {"prompt": "reaction force.\n\nThe defence secretary said: \"I mean, to be honest, the simple reality is Nato leadership did not approach anybody.

Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March)\n\nPiers Morgan says he is not aware of phone hacking taking place while he was editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nA High Court case against its owners, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), brought by Prince Harry and several other high-profile figures, began on Wednesday.\n\nLawyers argue that executives at the publisher knew about widespread phone hacking, but failed to act.\n\nSpeaking before the trial, Mr Morgan said: \"I've never hacked a phone. I've never told anybody to hack a phone.\"\n\nThe long-awaited case involves allegations that the publisher of the Mirror illegally gathered information about the Duke of Sussex and a number of other celebrities to generate stories.\n\nIn written arguments put before the court, the barrister representing Prince Harry said it was \"inconceivable\" that Mr Morgan and other editors did not know about MGN journalists instructing private investigators to obtain information.\n\nMr Morgan has always denied any knowledge of phone hacking or illegal activity at the Daily Mirror when he was editor.\n\nHe was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004\n\nHe was interviewed by the BBC's Amol Rajan before the trial began. In it, Mr Morgan said he thought phone hacking - the interception of mobile phone voicemail messages - was completely wrong.\n\nHe added it \"shouldn't have been happening\" and said it was \"lazy journalists being lazy\". He said there was no evidence that he knew anything about it.\n\nAsked in the interview whether it stretched credulity that, as a hands-on editor, he didn't know what was going on, Mr Morgan replied: \"I didn't. So I don't care whether it stretches people's credulity, or not.\"\n\nThe former editor pointed out that although there were civil cases happening, none of the journalists who worked with him at the Daily Mirror have been arrested in connection with phone hacking.\n\nMr Morgan worked at the Daily Mirror for nearly a decade, but he said none of the civil cases had anything to do with him.\n\n\"I've not been called to give evidence, I know nothing about it,\" he told BBC News. Asked if he was worried about Prince Harry's legal action, he said he \"couldn't give a monkey's cuss\".\n\n\"I don't give a damn what actions he wants to take,\" he said.\n\nPiers Morgan told Amol Rajan he wasn't aware of any phone hacking while he was at the Daily Mirror\n\nIn 2015, MGN, which publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, paid out \u00a31.2m in damages to eight phone hacking victims who refused to settle out of court, including Paul Gascoigne and the actor Sadie Frost.\n\nOther cases have been settled out of court so damages to individuals remain unknown.\n\nOn Wednesday, MGN apologised to Prince Harry for one instance of unlawful information gathering in relation to a story which appeared in the Sunday People in 2004, but it denied allegations of voicemail interception in all the cases being examined.\n\nMr Morgan pointed out he only worked for the Daily Mirror and had no responsibility for the Sunday Mirror or Sunday People, or other titles.\n\nA MGN spokesman said: \"Where historical wrongdoing has taken place we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.\n\n\"MGN is now part of a very different company.

One of the soldiers put a gun to my head and said that if I didn't admit to killing the soldier that they were going to shoot me and just leave me there.\n\n\"I had a hood over my head and a gun at my head in the middle of a field and was told I would be killed if I didn't admit it. There were no ifs or buts, I just said I did it.\n\n\"I didn't think about going to prison or anything like that, I just confessed to make them stop.\"\n\nThe term \"waterboarding\" was not in use at the time, but Mr Holden's description of what happened to him, which he outlined in court at the time, are remarkably similar to the accounts of others who claim to have been subjected to the same form of torture by the CIA in recent years.\n\nAlthough Mr Holden had an alibi for the time of the shooting, and the only evidence against him was the confession he said he had been forced to sign, he was convicted.\n\n\"They knew I did not shoot that soldier, they knew. There was no evidence whatsoever apart from that statement that I signed,\" he says.\n\nHe was released from prison in 1989 after serving 17 years. Since then, he has campaigned to clear his name and the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was established to investigate possible miscarriages of justice, referred his case to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe commission took the decision based on new evidence and doubts about \"the admissibility of reliability\" of his confession.\n\nSome of the new material included evidence discovered by a Guardian journalist, Ian Cobain, that water torture was used by the British military at the time, despite repeated denials. The journalist was an expert witness for Mr Holden's legal team.\n\nLast month, Mr Holden was granted permission to appeal after the Public Prosecution Service said it would not oppose the move. A spokesman for the PPS said its decision was based on confidential evidence compiled by the Criminal Cases Review Commission which had not been available to prosecutors at the time of the trial.\n\n\"The court of trial was therefore deprived of relevant material that might have led to a different outcome on the question of the admissibility of the incriminating statements, which were the sole basis of the conviction,\" the spokesman added.\n\n\"In those circumstances the director concluded that it would not be appropriate to oppose the appeal.\"\n\nLiam Holden said he lost his family as well as his liberty during those 17 years in jail.\n\n\"I have five brothers and five sisters, but I don't really know them.

The place is getting worse.\"\n\nThe message in February, which I received from a member of the maternity team, was stark but unsurprising. In a series of texts over the previous few months, the person had been getting increasingly concerned about what was happening at the East Kent trust.\n\nThe leadership is \"totally ineffective\" read one message. \"How long do we have to keep hearing this narrative - we accept bad things happened, we have learned and are putting it right. Nothing changes.\"\n\nFriday's report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is unfortunately just the latest marker in a near-decade of failure to improve maternity care at the trust. The revelation that inspectors considered closing the unit at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford comes nine years after the trust's head of midwifery made a similar recommendation for the same reasons - that it was a danger to women and babies. The failure to act decisively then allowed many poor practices to continue.\n\nAn independent review published last October found that between 2009 and 2020, at least 45 babies may have survived with better care, while 12 other babies and 23 mothers wouldn't have suffered harm if they'd received good maternity care.\n\nPut simply, the trust has repeatedly failed to provide good care - and then failed to act when presented with evidence of poor care.\n\nConsider the extraordinary deaths of two new mothers from herpes at two of the trust's hospitals, just six weeks apart in 2018. The trust told the families there was no connection between the deaths. There were. A BBC investigation three years later found they'd been operated on by the same surgeon, and that the trust had failed to test him for herpes despite being told to do so.\n\nWhen those disclosures led to an inquest being ordered, the trust delayed its start for weeks by making last-minute legal arguments about wanting the coroner to put reporting restrictions on naming the surgeon, arguments it could have made months earlier, as it had been repeatedly discussed at previous hearings.\n\nWhen the inquest took evidence, a consultant microbiologist at the trust, Dr Sam Moses, was reprimanded for allegedly coaching a colleague in how to respond to answers while another clinician was sitting in the witness box.\n\nDr Moses also admitted that he hadn't told one family about the connections between the deaths, despite being in a meeting in which the mother of one of the women who had died asked explicitly about a link. He told the court that \"my role was to assist the trust. I didn't know whose responsibility it was to tell\" about the connection.\n\nAt the heart of the trust's problems, it seems, is a dysfunctional culture that stretches back almost a decade. In 2015, a review of its maternity services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found multiple problems, including consultants failing to carry out ward rounds, assess women or attend out-of-hours calls. The report was dismissed as \"a load of rubbish\" by the trust. A Maternity Improvement Plan, overseen by NHS England, was devised. However, by the end of 2019 fewer than a quarter of its action points had been completed.\n\nImproving care is virtually impossible if colleagues don't get along. An Employment Tribunal decision, published in February, concluded that a \"toxic and difficult working environment\" existed at William Harvey Hospital's maternity unit where people were \"shouted and sworn at over differences of professional opinion\".\n\nOlukemi Akinmeji, a black midwife, sued the trust for race discrimination and victimisation after colleagues \"joked\" that they should \"check their bags\" on her last day at the hospital. Ms Akinmeji, who worked at the William Harvey between 2018 and 2020, won her case.\n\nThe tribunal judgement described hearing evidence of a broken working environment and a foul-mouthed registrar that one former colleague described as \"totally unprofessional\". Since Ms Akinmeji left the trust, that doctor has been promoted to consultant, after apparently being told to cut out the swearing.\n\nThree former staff have told the BBC there is a cli", "gt": "que of senior midwives at the William Harvey, nicknamed by some as \"the untouchables\".

But he played only four times and started one match for the Serie A side this term - and scored one goal - following a series of injuries, and his contract was set to expire this month. \"There are too many emotions for me right now. Forza Milan and goodbye,\" an emotional Ibrahimovic said, holding back tears. \"The first time I came here you gave me happiness, the second time you gave me love. \"You welcomed me with open arms, you made me feel at home, I will be a Milanista for the rest of my life.\" Ibrahimovic won 34 trophies - including 14 league titles - in a career that began in the last century, and was nominated for the Ballon d'Or 11 times. The one major club trophy that eluded him was the Champions League, with his only European title coming with Manchester United in the shape of the 2017 Europa League. The striker also retires as Sweden's all-time top scorer with 62 international goals in 122 matches. He quit the national side after Euro 2016 but returned in 2021 for their unsuccessful World Cup qualifying campaign. \"I used to be scared when journalists asked by about my future, but now I can accept it, I'm ready,\" he told reporters after his announcement. \"I've been doing this all my life.

A move to Italy followed in 2004 with Juventus, where he won two league titles, both of which were later stripped from the club as a result of the Calciopoli scandal. However, the Swede won three more Serie A titles with his next club, Inter Milan, before a move to Barcelona in 2009. Ibrahimovic spent only one season at the Catalan club, winning a La Liga title before being loaned to AC Milan, a move which was made permanent in 2011. A year later, however, and Ibrahimovic was on the move again, signing for Paris St-Germain, where he scored 113 goals in 122 league appearances and won four Ligue 1 trophies. In July 2016, he signed for Manchester United for a two-year spell with the Premier League club that saw him win the League Cup and the Europa League. Ibrahimovic signed for MLS side LA Galaxy in 2018, spending two seasons in California before making his return to AC Milan.\n\u2022 None No small talk, no messages, just one kiss:\n\u2022 None 'The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life': Joe Wicks learns why sleep is fundamental to our health\n\nLt-Gen Tsokov has reportedly died following a missile strike in Berdyansk\n\nA senior Russian general has been killed in a missile strike in Ukraine, Russian sources have said.\n\nLt Gen Oleg Tsokov is said to have died in a strike on a hotel housing Russian military commanders in Berdyansk, on Ukraine's occupied southern coast.\n\nRussia's defence ministry has not officially confirmed his death.

Refugees and activists tell the BBC intimidating tactics are tearing communities apart.\n\n\"My dearest son,\" said Alim's mother as she flickered into view. \"I didn't think I'd see you before I died.\"\n\nAlim - not his real name - says he was overcome by the moment. The reunion over a video call was their first contact in six years, since he fled as a refugee to the UK.\n\nBut it was bittersweet: someone else was in control of the call. Like all Uyghurs - a mostly Muslim minority from north-western China - Alim's mother lives under intense surveillance and control. They could never call each other directly.\n\nInstead, a middleman phoned Alim and his mother from two separate mobiles. He held the phone screens to face each other, so the pair could see wobbly images of each other - and hear muffled sound from the speakers.\n\nAlim says they barely spoke, and spent most of the call in tears.\n\nHe doesn't know if the plain white wall he could see behind his mother was in her house in Xinjiang or an internment camp, where the Chinese government is alleged to have detained more than a million Uyghurs. China has long denied those charges.\n\nBut Alim says he knew this contact with his mother would come at a cost - because the man brokering the call was a Chinese police officer.\n\nUyghurs in China live under intense surveillance and more than a million have allegedly been detained in internment camps (file photo from 2019)\n\nWhen the officer called again, he asked Alim to attend meetings of Uyghur human rights activists, gather intelligence and pass it back to the Chinese state.\n\n\"Whenever there was an anti-China protest in London, they would call me and ask who would be attending,\" says Alim, who shared with the BBC recordings of the phone calls requesting he work as a spy.\n\nAlim was offered money, too, so he could try to befriend the leaders of campaign groups - many of them UK citizens - by taking them to restaurants and picking up the bill.\n\nThe officer suggested setting up a company as a front, in case suspicions were raised about his newfound wealth. Plenty of businesses had already been set up on behalf of others for that exact purpose, Alim was told.\n\nThe implied threat, that his family may come to harm if he refused, has left him in a vicious bind.\n\n\"They are using my family as hostages,\" Alim says. \"I am living in a dark moment.\"\n\nWatch more on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on Monday 31 July, or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer\n\nThe tactics employed by governments to police their diasporas abroad are known as transnational repression.\n\nResearch suggests this particular kind - controlling access to family members in the home country through video calls, in exchange for compliance overseas - is commonly used by Chinese police.\n\nDr David Tobin at the University of Sheffield has conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date, with his colleague Nyrola Elim\u00e4. They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression.\n\n\"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk.\n\nDr David Tobin says all Uyghurs living abroad are victims of transnational repression\n\nThis severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not.\n\nIn the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people.

Each time a case is reported to the authorities, questions should be lodged directly with the Chinese government, requesting assurance that family members are safe, he says.\n\n\"We are your citizens, your neighbours and your taxpayers. Our governments should take some responsibility,\" says Mr Ayup.\n\nDr Tobin recognises the complications inherent in tackling the issue. \"Saying 'would you like to speak to your family?' isn't a crime. We know it's a threat. We know it breaks communities, and causes mental health problems and trauma, but it is not a crime on British soil,\" he says.\n\nThe UK Home Office says attempts to intimidate overseas critics are \"unacceptable\", that an internal review into transnational repression is underway, and all such incidents should be reported to law enforcement.\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London called the allegations of transnational repression \"totally groundless\". The Chinese government \"protects Uyghurs and their communication with overseas relatives in accordance with the law\", it said.\n\nAlim chose not to report his case to the police, but confessed his predicament to a group of Uyghur rights activists in London.\n\nOne of the group's leaders told us the requests were very common, and posed challenges to the integrity of the community - but insisted their advocacy work would continue. In their experience, almost all advances from Chinese police are rejected.\n\nAlim wrestled with the issue before reaching a decision. \"I realised that betraying others for the sake of my family would mean selling out my nation, and I couldn't do that.\n\n\"If that was the price I had to pay, so be it.\" He too refused China's offer.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

They started chatting for hours, long talks during which she discovered he was \"gentle and sensitive\".\n\nBut even as Shanshan and her partner Guodong share sweet messages across the Taiwan Strait - preparing to meet her parents during the Chinese New Year festival - their governments are trading a ramped-up war of words in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential elections on Saturday.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping has cast the decision at Taiwan's ballot box as a choice between war and peace. Under his leadership, Beijing has taken an ever sharper, firmer and often more aggressive tone towards the democratically-governed island, warning the world that it alone will decide how and when unification will happen.\n\nHowever, despite regular military activities in the Taiwan Strait, President Xi has also repeatedly offered \"peaceful reunification\", while Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office maintains that \"both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family\".\n\nBut those most likely to listen to this message are its own people - not those living across the strait.\n\nTaiwan sits just 68 nautical miles away from China's Pingtan island - just visible through binoculars\n\nShanshan and Guodong have very different views on the future of Taiwan.\n\n\"My boyfriend just wants to maintain the status quo and doesn't want independence or unification.

Gordon, her partner, is a convicted sex offender.\n\nThe couple had left their home in Eltham, south-east London, in September, after Ms Marten first showed signs of pregnancy.\n\nAfter the car fire in January, the couple were on the move for a total of 53 days before being found - apparently evading police. They were arrested on 27 February.\n\nPolice said the pair would look away or cover their faces whenever they were near CCTV cameras. In the images of them that have been captured, they can often be seen wearing face masks.\n\nDetectives also said Ms Marten was from a wealthy family, from whom she was estranged after meeting 48-year-old Gordon, and that her inherited wealth could allow the couple to live off-grid for some time.\n\nThis is what we know about the couple's movements, based on CCTV images.\n\nCCTV still released by police of the couple's car on fire on the hard-shoulder of the M61 in Bolton on the evening of 5 January\n\nThe investigation began after a car was found on fire at around 18.30 on Thursday 5 January on the hard shoulder of the M61 near Bolton.

Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?\n\nA powerful South Carolina lawyer has been found guilty of murdering his wife and son to distract from his multi-million dollar financial crimes.\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.\n\nHe faces a long prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.\n\nMaggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.\n\nAlex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.\n\n\"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law,\" said South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson.\n\nThe case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - has captivated the country, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO.\n\nMurdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area.

By this time, he had gone on a crash diet, his familiar portly figure reduced by five stone, and published the Nigel Lawson Diet Book.\n\nIn 2004, he re-emerged as a fierce critic of the concept of man-made climate change.

It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.\n\nRussia is building new housing to replace what it destroyed\n\n\"It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities.

On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that's where your problems end: 'You're one of us now'. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,\" Ivan said.\n\nMariupol is also becoming part of Russia's financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.\n\nRussia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.\n\nRussian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.\n\nThe media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard", "gt": "at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.\n\nMany current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia's presence.\n\n\"We've suffered enough under Ukraine.

However, after 10 weeks the procedure is carried out in a clinic.\n\nProsecutors argued Foster had provided false information knowing she was over the time limit and had made online searches which they said indicated \"careful planning\".\n\nThe court heard between February and May 2020 she had searched \"how to hide a pregnancy bump\", \"how to have an abortion without going to the doctor\" and \"how to lose a baby at six months\".\n\nBased on the information she provided the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), she was sent the tablets because it was estimated she was seven weeks pregnant.\n\nThe woman was initially charged with child destruction, the court heard\n\nHer defence argued that lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare and so instead she had to search for information online.\n\n\"The defendant may well have made use of services had they been available at the time,\" said her barrister Barry White. \"This will haunt her forever.\"\n\nOn 11 May 2020, having taken the abortion pills, an emergency call was made at 18:39 BST saying she was in labour.\n\nThe baby was born not breathing during the phonecall and was confirmed dead about 45 minutes later.\n\nA post-mortem examination recorded the baby girl's cause of death as stillbirth and maternal use of abortion drugs and she was estimated to be between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation.\n\nFoster, from Staffordshire, already had three sons before she became pregnant again in 2019.\n\nThe court heard she had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby.\n\nThe judge accepted she was \"in emotional turmoil\" as she", "gt": "sought to hide the pregnancy.\n\nFoster was initially charged with child destruction, which she denied.\n\nShe later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.\n\nSentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall said it was a \"tragic\" case, adding that if she had pleaded guilty earlier he may have been able to consider suspending her jail sentence.\n\nHe", "response": "sought to hide the pregnancy from her partner.\n\nHowever, she was jailed for 28 months, with 14 months to be served in prison before being released on licence.\n\nFoster was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Det Insp Cheryl Hannan from West Mercia Police said: \"Carla Foster's actions were deliberate and designed to hide her pregnancy from her partner.\n\n\"She had a duty of care to her unborn child, regardless of the circumstances of its conception,", "rougeL": 0.19631901840490798, "rougeL_recall": 0.2, "rouge1": 0.3067484662576687, "rouge1_recall": 0.3125}, {"prompt": ". If it is signed by Tennessee's governor, Republican Bill Lee, it will go into effect on 1 July.\n\nThe bill's backers were spurred on by a government report released last year on solar geoengineering, which is the idea of cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. The White House, though, has said that there are no plans \"to establish a comprehensive research programme focused on solar radiation modification.\"\n\nSeveral witnesses who testified before the Tennessee legislature cited debunked conspiracy theories or speculated about secret government geoengineering programmes, according to Scott Banbury, conservation director of the state's branch of the Sierra Club, an environmental organisation.\n\nTheir claims were troubling, he said.\n\n\"As a serious environmental organisation, if what was in the bill was actually going on we would be calling for a stop to it,\" he said. \"It's not happening.\"\n\nThe legislation focuses on geoengineering, a very broad category which includes mostly theoretical large-scale action to mitigate climate change.\n\nGeoengineering is controversial even among legitimate climate scientists, because of uncertainty around its usefulness and the possibility of unintended outcomes.\n\nPlanet-wide climate engineering is distinct from more routine weather modification, such as cloud seeding, which increases rainfall over specific areas and is used in several US states.\n\n\"Chemtrails\", meanwhile, is a separate, pseudoscientific idea that governments or corporations are spraying chemicals from planes to kill, control or poison people.\n\nConspiracy theorists point to white plumes of water vapour trailing behind passenger aeroplanes, commonly called contrails, as proof of sinister and secret plots, but lack evidence for their claims.\n\nThe most common claim of proof is \"simply that aircraft contrails look 'different', without any comparative analysis,\" according to a report from a Harvard geoengineering group.\n\n\"This as convincing as saying that alien beings walk among us in disguise as people because some people act very strangely,\" it said.\n\nIn recent decades speculation about chemtrails has risen as the number of airline flights - and thus the number of contrails - has surged.\n\nIn the debate over the Tennessee bill, lawmakers and witnesses cited a range of both reliable and debunked facts about geoengineering and weather modification, and at least one witness said she believed the White House was engaged in climate experiments but could not provide definitive proof.\n\nThe legislation's sponsor, Monty Fritts, called it \"a very common-sense thing to do\".\n\nAlthough several lawmakers mentioned chemtrails while the bill was being discussed, during Monday's session Mr Fritts focused on cloud seeding.\n\n\"Everything that goes up must come down, and those chemicals that we knowingly and willingly inject into the atmosphere simply to control the weather or the climate are affecting our health,\" he said.\n\nIn a joking response, John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat from Nashville, introduced an amendment that would protect fictional beasts.\n\n\"This amendment would make sure that we are protecting yetis, or Sasquatch or Bigfoot, from whatever this conspiracy is that we're passing in this legislation,\" he said during debate.\n\nJohn Ray Clemmons introduced an amendment designed to poke fun at the bill\n\n\"This legislation is not to be taken seriously,\" he said.\n\nMr Clemmons told the BBC that several of his fellow lawmakers believe in QAnon theories and conspiracies about vaccines being hidden in food.\n\n\"This is unfortunately nothing new,\" he said. \"There's a lot of things we could be doing to reduce living costs for our working families, but we are wasting time with this.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Fritts said: \"Nothing that helps ensure that our air, water, and soil are cleaner could be a waste of time.\"\n\n\"We cannot change what people believe,\" the spokesperson said about the persistent conspiracy theory allegations. \"We can only present the information and let them make up their own minds.\"\n\nAlthough the Tennessee bill appears to be the first of its kind to pass a state legislature, lawmakers in several other states including Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Minnesota and New Hampshire have introduced similar legislation.\n\nMr Banbury, the Sierra Club official, noted that witnesses", "gt": "supporting the bill travelled from outside Tennessee, and several have testified in favour of similar laws in other states.\n\n\"As a grassroots organiser I'm impressed that a cadre of the same people have had such influence, and that they can muster up so much power,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Lawrence, pictured in late 2022, is the producer on a new documentary called Bread and Roses, which explores the day-to-day lives of three women in Afghanistan\n\n\"You only oppress women,\" the young woman says to", "response": "at the Tennessee hearing focused on cloud seeding, which he said was a legitimate and widely used weather modification technique.\n\n\"The problem is that the same witnesses who were talking about cloud seeding were also talking about chemtrails,\" he said.\n\n\"The two are not the same, and the two are not even in the same universe of possibilities.\"\n\nThe American Meteorological Society (AMS) has said that cloud seeding is a \"proven and effective method of increasing rainfall\".\n\nThe AMS also said that \"there is no evidence of a conspiracy by government or", "rougeL": 0.15730337078651688, "rougeL_recall": 0.16279069767441862, "rouge1": 0.2696629213483146, "rouge1_recall": 0.27906976744186046}, {"prompt": "omen are not properly celebrated around the world.\"\n\nMani was well aware of the challenges of filming in such private and dangerous situations.\n\n\"I understand how to deal with difficulties because I am one of them.\n\n\"They are not victims,\" she says, \"they are heroes.\"\n\nBut getting the balance right between keeping the women safe and telling their story was not easy.

It's a hard thing to market.\"\n\nAs women executive producers, Ciarrocchi and Lawrence are still in the minority in Hollywood.

They also support rival sides across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq - and most overtly in Yemen.\n\nIran has supported Shia Houthi rebels who forced out the Saudi-backed government in 2014, while Saudi Arabia has led a devastating air campaign against the Houthis since the following year.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack it.\n\nIn the most serious incident of its kind, drones and missiles struck major Saudi oil facilities in 2019, causing damage and disruption to production. Saudi Arabia and its US ally blamed Iran for the attack - something Iran denied.\n\nPrevious attempts at reconciliation have been unsuccessful, but on Friday the two countries said they would reopen embassies within two months. They will also re-establish trade and security relations.\n\nThe US cautiously welcomed the announcement. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the administration supported \"any effort to de-escalate tensions in the region\".

Mr Stockan said that \"nothing was off the table\" - including of course the much-publicised return to Norway or Denmark.\n\nReaction to the vote on the streets of Kirkwall has been fairly mixed.\n\nSome don't want to see any tax-payer money devoted to what one councillor described as \"frankly bizarre fantasies\".\n\nOthers feel that the council does get a raw deal from both Holyrood and Westminster, and that anything that gets the two governments to sit up and pay attention is worth looking at.\n\nThe eyes of the global media have been on Orkney for the past few days.\n\nIt's now up to the islands council to capitalise on that attention.\n\nThe Strangford Lough Ferry service will be suspended for seven days due to the strike\n\nHundreds of schoolchildren who use the Strangford Ferry in County Down face disruption over the next seven days due to strike action by ferry workers.\n\nThe service will not be operational for a week, meaning commuters will have to find an alternative means of transport.\n\nOne principal said four of his pupils will be left without any way of getting to school.\n\nThe trade union Unite said members voted to strike after rejecting a pay offer of \u00a3552 extra per year.\n\nIts general secretary, Sharon Graham, said the offer was a \"slap in the face\" for those responsible for the maintenance of vital public services and infrastructure.\n\nThe strike action began at 00:01 BST on Thursday and will continue until 00:00 on Wednesday 26 April.\n\nUnite and GMB union members within the roads service and forestry service have also begun industrial action.\n\nWith a journey time of 10 minutes, the ferry crossing can save a 50-mile drive around Strangford Lough from Portaferry to Strangford.\n\nAmong those on strike is skipper Jonathon Brownlee who said any disruption was \"regrettable\" but staff has come \"to the end of the road.\"\n\n\"After 15 years of austerity, our pay has now fallen about 15% behind where prices have pushed inflation,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\n\"In addition to that we know for a fact that we aren't being paid the market value for the job we do and we are being taken for granted.\"\n\nStrangford Ferry skipper Jonathan Brownlee said he believed workers were \"being taken advantage of\" by their employers\n\nAlan Perry of the GMB union said that the strike would have a huge impact which was \"entirely avoidable\".\n\n\"Workers are demanding a fair pay increase to protect themselves and their families from surging prices,\" he added.\n\nOne of the affected pupils, Owen, travels on the ferry to St Patrick's Grammar School in Downpatrick.\n\nHe told BBC News NI on Thursday that he may be more tired than usual but added at least it is only for a week.\n\n\"I found out on Tuesday; some people found out quicker than me, today", "gt": "it was just awkward getting up that bit earlier and not knowing what is going to happen,\" he said.\n\nSt Patrick's Grammar School pupil Owen admits he may be more tired than usual this week\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure said it would not be able to provide the minimum number of crew needed to safely operate the ferry service and it had no option but to suspend services during the strike period.\n\nSpeaking about the wider industrial action, the department added: \"While contingency arrangements are in place, to limit potential impacts as much as possible, this", "response": "it was just a bit of a shock,\" he said.\n\n\"I have to get up a bit earlier to get the bus, but it's only for a week so I'll just have to deal with it.\"\n\nSt Patrick's Grammar School pupil Owen says he may be more tired than usual this week\n\nAnother pupil, Mia, said she was \"a bit stressed\" about the strike as she relies on the ferry to get to school.\n\n\"I have to get up a bit earlier to get the bus, but it's only for a", "rougeL": 0.30208333333333337, "rougeL_recall": 0.29896907216494845, "rouge1": 0.44791666666666663, "rouge1_recall": 0.44329896907216493}, {"prompt": "feel the freedom to exercise that choice\".\n\nHe said that a trial in West Yorkshire, where NHS trusts are sharing waiting lists for conditions affecting blood vessels, showed the approach worked.\n\nThe change would also \"build more capacity in the system\", he added, to help tackle waiting lists that have ballooned since the pandemic.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Streeting said Labour also wanted to see a greater share of NHS spending outside of hospitals to tackle health problems earlier.\n\nHe said that the proportions of spending were \"very different\" in other developed economies that have \"much better outcomes than we have here in the UK\".\n\n\"We under invest in primary care, community services, mental health, diagnostics, and capital, and we've got to shift that focus,\" he added.\n\n\"Lots of hospital trust leaders are already doing this. They recognise that the pressure we see in hospitals is in part driven by the clogged front door to the NHS in primary care and community services as well as delayed discharges in social care.\"\n\nSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, former Tory chairman Sir Jake Berry rubbished Labour's approach, saying the party was aiming to \"do more of what the Conservative government is already doing\".\n\nThe government says it wants to boost community NHS services. It recently announced plans to let high street pharmacies prescribe a greater range of common prescription drugs, including antibiotics, to ease the pressure on GPs.\n\nAnd as part of efforts to cut waiting lists, ministers say new community \"diagnostic centres\" opening this year will allow people to access checks and scans for conditions such as cancer, heart disease or lung disease without travelling to a hospital.\n\nLabour does not want to make multiple expensive promises. But it might be tricky to translate its ambitions into concrete plans that the public believe will make an immediate difference - and getting voters excited about structural changes to the NHS might be a tall order.\n\nMr Streeting also confirmed that a review of social care policy carried out for the party will be published next month.\n\nThe report, by a Labour-affiliated think tank, is expected to inform the party's position on social care ahead of the next election.\n\nHe did not offer details of what will be in the blueprint, but said Labour has previously stressed the need to improve pay in the sector, as well supporting people more in their own homes.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has scrapped a plan to invest nearly $1bn (\u00a3806m) to build a new corporate campus in Florida, it announced.\n\nThe reversal comes amid an escalating feud between the entertainment giant and the state's Republican-led government headed by Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe plan would have seen about 2,000 employees relocate to a Disney-owned complex at Lake Nona, near Orlando.\n\nThe cancellation was announced in an internal email to employees on Thursday.\n\nThe email, seen by BBC News, said the company's decision was the result of \"considerable changes\" that have taken place since it was first announced.\n\nIn the email, Josh D'Amaro, the head of Disney's theme park division, also referred to \"changing business conditions\".\n\nWhile the email does not mention politics or Mr DeSantis, it has been interpreted as alluding to mounting tensions between Disney and Florida lawmakers.\n\n\"Disney announced the possibility of a Lake Nona campus nearly two years ago. Nothing ever came of the project, and the state was unsure whether it would come to fruition,\" Mr DeSantis' office said in a statement.\n\n\"Given the company's financial straits, falling market cap and declining stock price, it is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures.\"\n\nThe internal Disney email noted that the decision to scrap the project comes after \"new leadership\" at the company, referring to the sudden departure in November of ex-CEO Bob Chapek.\n\nThe Lake Nona campus, which had not been built, would have been a new home for employees at the firm's secretive theme park research and development arm, known as Imagineers, who were asked to move from California to Florida.\n\nMr D'Amaro's email said relocation would no longer be required and it would discuss next steps with those he said had already done so.\n\nMany of the jobs that were supposed to relocate to Florida were higher paid", "gt": ", white collar and tech-focused positions.\n\nThe Orlando Business Journal reported the project was valued at about $867m and that the average annual wage for the positions was $120,000.\n\nBob Iger, the former chief executive who made a stunning return to replace his successor, Mr Chapek, has announced sweeping changes to boost the firm's business, which has come under pressure as the traditional movie and television industries decline.\n\nDisney launched a streaming offering, Disney+, in 2019,", "response": ", white collar and tech-focused, and it is unclear how many will be affected by the cancellation.\n\nThe email noted that the decision to scrap the project comes after \"new leadership\" at the company, referring to the sudden departure in November of ex-CEO Bob Chapek.\n\nMr Chapek left Disney after clashing with the company's board over his stewardship of the business.\n\nHe was replaced by Bob Iger, the former chief executive who returned to the company in a surprise move.\n\nMr Iger, who is credited with", "rougeL": 0.26506024096385544, "rougeL_recall": 0.28205128205128205, "rouge1": 0.3975903614457831, "rouge1_recall": 0.4230769230769231}, {"prompt": "circuit during a Formula 2 race in 2019.\n\nThe race organisers said: \"We want to express our sincere condolences to the family, team and friends.\"\n\nThey added: \"Royal Automobile Club of Belgium, the Circuit of Spa-Francorchamps and SRO Motorsports Group join Alpine and ACI in expressing their sincerest condolences to the driver's family, team and friends.\"\n\nOrganisers of the headline GT race, the 24 Hours of Spa, said on social media: \"All start line entertainments for the 24 Hours of Spa have been cancelled and there will be a minute's silence before the start of the race to honour the memory of Dilano.\"\n\nThe Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine is a European Formula Three racing series intended to be a stepping stone to the FIA Formula Three Championship.\n\nFormula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali said on Twitter: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Dilano van 't Hoff today at Spa-Francorchamps.\n\n\"Dilano died in pursuit of his dream to reach the pinnacle of motorsport.

That's what we were wondering most of Monday - two days after a dramatic insurrection by the Wagner Group that saw a convoy of mercenary fighters headed to Moscow.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Putin announced a deal to end the Wagner mutiny late on Saturday. But when would the president himself comment on the controversial agreement?\n\nIt was controversial because the Wagner mercenaries had rebelled, seized military sites (with apparent ease) and then marched on Moscow; Russian air force pilots had been killed in the mutiny. Yet the Kremlin had agreed not to prosecute Wagner fighters or their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in return for calling off the uprising.\n\nOver the last week, President Putin has made a series of unusual public appearances - all televised - in an apparent attempt to steady the ship.\n\nOn Monday we hear from Mr Prigozhin: an audio message posted online presenting his side of the story. He says his men headed to Moscow to \"hold to account\" those leaders he blamed for \"mistakes\" in the Ukraine war.\n\nThen late into the evening, an announcement is made. \"Standby: President Putin will address the nation.\" Now it feels like the Kremlin leader is playing catch-up.\n\nPutin appears on TV screens after 10pm. A late-night address from him is very unusual. Social media buzzes with rumours that this will be a speech that will \"decide the fate of Russia\". With trepidation we switch on Russian TV to hear the president speak.\n\nIt quickly becomes clear this address will not decide the country's fate. There are no major announcements. But the five-minute speech does provide clues to how the Kremlin is going to spin the dramatic events of the weekend to its benefit.\n\nPutin paints a picture of a Russia that has united to defeat the treachery of Wagner's leaders.\n\nHe tries to bring everyone on side: he thanks the Russian public, Russian officials, religious leaders, the Russian armed forces and his security services. He distinguishes between the leaders of the mutiny and regular Wagner fighters and commanders, whom he praises as patriots. Crucially, he presents himself as the man who averted major bloodshed.\n\n\"As soon as these events began to unfold,\" he says, \"in keeping with my direct instructions, steps were taken to avoid spilling blood\".\n\nRemember that controversy I was talking about? He doesn't address that. But, hey, Russia has stepped back from the brink. That's the main thing.\n\nOn Monday he was playing catch-up. By Tuesday morning it's full steam ahead to try to restore his authority.\n\nAt a hastily arranged event the Russian authorities are going heavy - very heavy - on the pomp and ceremony. Some 2,500 soldiers, Russian Guard and security officials are lined up on the Kremlin's Cathedral Square. This is the site of coronation (and funeral) processions of Russian tsars.\n\nCue Putin: To the presidential fanfare he descends the many steps of the Kremlin down onto the square (red carpet all the way, of course) and with a backdrop of the onion domes of Kremlin cathedrals the president - and commander-in-chief - delivers a speech to his troops.\n\nBut even before he", "gt": "starts to speak, the imagery says it all.

Gently gripping the patient's gall bladder. But the grasping device was not physically connected to anything - it appeared to be levitating inside the person's body.\n\nIn reality, the jaws were being controlled remotely by a robot arm wielding a special magnet.\n\n\"We could see the critical structures, the blood vessels,\" says Dr Matthew Kroh of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. It wasn't long before he had removed the troublesome gall bladder with the help of his robotic assistant. This was one of two dozen or so similar surgeries he and his team have performed in recent months using their high-tech system.\n\n\"It allows us to do a very common operation in a less invasive way,\" he says, explaining that fewer incisions are now required for procedures such as this. But there are many other emerging applications that also use carefully manufactured magnets.\n\nPermanent magnets, the kind that keep colourful souvenirs stuck to the door of your fridge, might seem a fairly mature, well-established technology. They've been used for centuries, after all. And yet, today, researchers and companies are expending huge efforts on making magnets more powerful and efficient than ever before.\n\nThis is because, increasingly, magnets are used in all kinds of ascendant technologies - including EV motors and wind turbines. They are, therefore, crucial for electrification. However, magnets are generally made using rare earth elements, the products of dirty mining operations. And, at present, China massively dominates global permanent magnet production, with more than 90% market share.\n\nMany argue that we need cleaner and more widely distributed magnet manufacturing facilities. The future, they say, depends on it.\n\n\"My job is brilliant,\" says Matthew Swallow, technical product manager for Bunting Magnetics in the UK. \"Nobody else, I don't think, gets involved in so many things.\"\n\nHis firm makes magnets that are used in all kinds of systems - from cochlear implants, to emergency brakes on rollercoasters, including at Alton Towers. Bunting Magnetics has even supplied magnets to Nasa.\n\nMatthew Swallow says magnets have become much more powerful over the past 10 years\n\nMr Swallow says that, even during the past 10 years or so, the availability of higher grade magnets made with the rare earth element neodymium has improved. For such magnets designed to cope with temperatures up to 200C, a grade of N35 used to be the maximum. But now N52 grade versions are commercially available.\n\n\"You can literally make the magnet 60% less massive and get the same level of performance,\" explains Mr Swallow.\n\nIn an electric motor, a magnetic field helps an internal coil to spin. This might be used to drive an axle and turn the wheels of an electric car, for example. Higher grade magnets mean motors that run more efficiently and cars that weigh slightly less overall. The careful addition of a small amount of dysprosium, another rare earth element, is one way to improve a magnet's efficiency.\n\nOne reason why China dominates global production of these magnets is financial incentives, says Ross Embleton, senior analyst for metals & mining - rare earths at Wood Mackenzie. Rare", "gt": "earth permanent magnet material is subject to a 13% VAT discount on export from the country, and provincial governments give support on energy costs, for example, which also helps buoy up magnet-making facilities.\n\n\"It's a really, really challenging industry to compete in if you're outside of China,\" says Mr Embleton.\n\nThat hasn't stopped some from trying. US firm Niron Magnetics says it has managed to make good quality magnets without rare earths. Instead, they use iron and nitrogen to make iron nitride magnets", "response": "earth permanent magnet material is subject to a 10% VAT discount in China, he says.\n\n\"That's a pretty significant incentive,\" he says. \"And it's one of the reasons why, when we look at the supply chain for these magnets, it's so heavily weighted towards China.\"\n\nRare earth permanent magnets are used in all kinds of motors, including those in electric cars\n\nThe Chinese government also imposes strict export controls on rare earths, says Mr Embleton.

Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitter's huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies.\n\nBut platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data.\n\nIn April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.\n\n\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"\n\nTwitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies.\n\nThere are other potential reasons for the move too.\n\nMr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. It's possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts.\n\nSignalled by a blue tick, \"verified\" status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from $8 (\u00a36.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile.\n\nAccording to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday.\n\nIn the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time.\n\nInitially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts.\n\nIn another update Mr Musk said \"several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively\".\n\nHe later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was \"rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis\".\n\nA server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services", "gt": "such as web pages for users.\n\nAdam Leon Smith from BCS, the UK's professional body for IT, said the move was \"very odd\" as limiting users' scroll time would affect the company's advertising revenue.\n\nMr Musk bought the company last year for $44bn (\u00a335bn) after much back and forth.

whether to keep their leader of more than 20 years or change to a more pro-Western path and roll back some of his sweeping presidential powers.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan is favourite to win Sunday's run-off vote, and promises a strong, multilateral Turkey. He says opposition claims of a dictatorship are smear campaigns and pure nonsense.\n\nHis chief rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a broad opposition, has billed the vote as a referendum on the future direction of Turkey and has sought the support of nationalist voters to increase his chance of victory.\n\nSince 2017, Mr Erdogan has run Turkey with extensive presidential power, from a vast palace in Ankara. As executive president he can declare a state of emergency and can pick or dismiss civil servants.\n\nHe accuses his opponents of being \"pro-LGBT\", while his Islamist-rooted party positions itself as on the side of the family and highlights its success in modernising Turkey.\n\nIf he wins on Sunday, not much will change, says Selim Koru, a member of Turkey's Tepav think tank. His powers are already so broad he won't seek to extend them further, he says.\n\nBut Alp Yenen, lecturer in Turkish studies at Leiden University, believes if Turkey's rampant inflation of more than 43% endures, the president's AK Party could accelerate what has been \"a slow pace of authoritarianism\".\n\nThe man seeking to replace Mr Erdogan wants to scrap the presidential system brought in five years ago and return to a parliament and prime minister in charge", "gt": ".

It gradually eroded the independence of the central bank, sacking three of its governors in quick succession, says Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc University.\n\nInflation soared, as interest rates were kept low - while Turkey's currency the lira depreciated to improve the trade balance and boost exports.\n\nOfficial inflation rates have fallen to 44% but Turks say the real inflation rate in shops and markets feels higher\n\nMr Erdogan still promises high growth, six million new jobs and a big push for tourism, but Prof Demiralp believes his policies will keep inflation as high as 45% for months to come.\n\nIf Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his allies win the presidency and parliament, she believes a return to orthodox economic policies and an independent central bank will lower inflation to 30% by the end of 2023 and it will continue to go down after that.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

In truth, they wasted chances throughout, but have shown enough quality, endeavour and bravery to suggest they have what it takes to get back into the series.\n\nFor Australia, the narrow win just about vindicates their cautious approach to combatting England's Bazballers. It was fitting that captain Cummins, the architect of the safety-first plan, played the vital role on the final day.\n\nThis was magnificent sporting theatre, whetting the appetite for the rest of the series and for the Test between England and Australia's women, which begins at Trent Bridge on Thursday.\n\nCummins and Lyon get revenge 18 years in the making\n\nIn 2005, Australia arrived on the fourth morning needing 107 with only two wickets remaining and almost got them thanks to the efforts of their last three batters - Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz.\n\nFrom a position almost as hopeless, Cummins and Lyon launched their own rescue mission and this time got Australia over the line.\n\nThe tourists had been almost inert for most of the day. At 107-3 overnight, they did not shift from a neutral gear. Khawaja, who made a century in the first innings, added only 31 runs from 116 balls and looked immovable.\n\nStokes somehow conjured the slower ball from his fragile body and Root held on to Carey to make England favourites, but fearsome competitors Cummins and Lyon refused to yield.\n\nRoot had already failed to cling on to a low caught-and-bowled chance when Cummins had six and the captain would later make him pay by crashing 14 from a single over.\n\nIn the next over, Stokes flung himself at a catch that would have matched his grab in the 2019 World Cup, but this time could not hold on.\n\nThe new ball was belatedly taken, but Australia's confidence grew. For every time the outside edge was beaten, a single was pinched. Cummins slapped Robinson past a flying Ollie Pope at cover, Lyon twice belted Stuart Broad down the ground for fours.\n\nThe outside edge was beaten, England kept the field back, James Anderson was ignored. Australia were within one hit of victory for more than two overs.\n\nWith three required, Cummins fended off a short ball and the flailing Brook could not prevent the boundary. Australia ended on 282 - their target back in 2005 - and the brilliant Cummins threw his bat in the air to begin wild celebrations.\n\nEngland had lost two of their past 12 Tests and one of those, against New Zealand in Wellington in February, was by just one run after they had made the Black Caps follow on.\n\nThis, though, will test the resolve of their new attitude under captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum like never before.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.\n\nThe European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\".\n\nThis week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.\n\nFormer UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders.\n\n\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter.

The hull of a deep-diving sub is usually spherical, which means it receives an equal amount of pressure at every point, but the Titan had a cylinder-shaped cabin. OceanGate gave it sensors to analyse the effects of changing pressure as it descended.\n\nThe glass viewport, from which passengers could see out, was only certified down to 1,300m, far short of the depths of the ocean floor where the Titantic wreck lay.\n\nRob McCallum, an explorer who acted as a consultant for OceanGate, became concerned when Mr Rush decided against getting official certification for the submersible.\n\nSubs can be certified or \"classed\" by marine organisations, like the American Bureau of Shipping or Lloyd's Register, meaning the vehicle must meet certain standards on things like stability, strength, safety and performance. But this process is not mandatory.\n\nIn emails to Mr Rush in March 2018, seen by BBC News, Mr McCallum said: \"You are wanting to use a prototype un-classed technology in a very hostile place. As much as I appreciate entrepreneurship and innovation, you are potentially putting an entire industry at risk.\n\n\"4,000m down in the mid-Atlantic is not the kind of place you can cut corners.\"\n\nMr Rush, apparently indignant, responded that he was \"tired of industry players who try to use a safety argument to stop innovation\".\n\nSafety was \"about culture, not paperwork\", he said. He talked of needing \"sensible design, extensive testing, and informed consent of the participants\", but said a piece of paper did not guarantee the safety of a sub.\n\nWhile he admitted deviating from some guidelines, such as \"overly conservative\" viewport limits, he argued the Titan's safety systems were \"way beyond\" anything else in use.\n\nHe wrote: \"I know that our engineering focused, innovative approach (as opposed to an existing standards compliance-focused design process) flies in the face of the submersible orthodoxy, but that is the nature of innovation.\"\n\nThe tense exchange ended after OceanGate's lawyers threatened legal action, Mr McCallum said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nBut Mr McCallum was not the only person linked to the company to speak out about safety.\n\nJust a few months earlier, former OceanGate employee David Lochridge raised concerns in an inspection report which identified \"numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns\", including how the hull had been tested.\n\nAlso in 2018, the Marine Technology Society sent a letter to OceanGate accusing it of making misleading claims about its design exceeding established industry safety standards, and warned that OceanGate's \"experimental\" approach could result in \"negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)\".\n\nIn a blog post in 2019, Mr Rush insisted that the majority of marine accidents were down to operator error. He said OceanGate took safety requirements very seriously, but that keeping an outside body informed on every modification before it was tested in a real-word setting was \"anathema to rapid innovation\".\n\nThe former employee told the BBC that while he had worked at OceanGate, he had felt confident in Mr Rush's commitment to safety.\n\n\"Rush was very level-headed, he knew what needed to be done,\" he said. \"He went on every sub dive, he was the pilot for every single one, and that's because he trusted the safety of the sub.\"\n\nMr Newman told the BBC the sub might not have been certified, but it was tested extensively. Mr Rush \"introduced new ideas and new pieces that are not conventional, and some people don't like that\", he said.\n\n\"The idea that this is something that's unique and Stockton did something wrong", "gt": "is disingenuous,\" he said.\n\nMr Rush himself told CBS reporter Mr Pogue last year that \"if you just want to be safe, don't get out of bed\".\n\n\"Don't get in your car.

Harrowing video shows people holding on to aircon units as hospital burns\n\nTwelve people have been detained by police for questioning after a hospital fire in Beijing killed at least 29, most of them patients.\n\nThe fire, among the deadliest in recent years, broke out in Changfeng Hospital at about 13:00 local time on Tuesday.\n\nAngry and concerned relatives rushed to the hospital hours later, only learning of the fire from local news reports.\n\n\"Seven or eight hours have passed and I didn't even receive a call,\" one relative told China Youth Daily.\n\nMany said they spent the night trying to locate loved ones.

A talking drone urged trapped patients to \"stay calm and wait [to be] rescued\".

Neither the nurses nor doctors picked up their phones.

McLaren's Oscar Piastri was sixth ahead of Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, whose team-mate George Russell was ninth. Japanese Yuki Tsunoda delighted home fans packed into the glorious Suzuka circuit with 10th place.\n\nVerstappen had looked a certainty for pole since the start of the weekend but in the end his margin was perhaps smaller than expected. Perez was just 0.066 seconds adrift of the three-time champion, who had been half a second clear of the field on this same circuit last September. Red Bull, though, were in a league of their own - Norris was 0.292secs off the pace in third, and himself a comfortable 0.193secs ahead of Sainz. Verstappen said he felt it had not been this greatest lap, adding: \"It was quite close at the end. This track is very sensitive with the tyre with the Tarmac being aggressive, and when you really want to go to the limit, it doesn't always work out. \"It is good to be on pole, a good starting position for tomorrow, and tomorrow is what counts.\" Perez said: \"It was really close with Max.

Sainz was 0.485secs from pole, a step forward for Ferrari compared to last year but their least impressive qualifying performance of the year. And Leclerc, while only 0.104secs off the Spaniard, was perplexed as to where his pace has gone this season. Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver on balance through their time as team-mates and he has been re-signed for next season alongside Lewis Hamilton while Sainz is looking for a drive. But Sainz has been more impressive this season and Leclerc said after qualifying: \"That's the best I can do. Honestly, I don't get it.\" It was an encouraging day for Alonso, whose Aston Martin has major floor upgrades this weekend and the veteran Spaniard put them to good effect. Second fastest in the first session, Alonso slipped back as qualifying progressed and others found their feet. He was seventh after his first run in the final top 10 shoot-out and was encouraged by his engineer to try to find the extra 0.15secs that separated him from a place in the top four at the time. Alonso replied saying: \"I don't know what to do to go faster; it felt like a good lap.\" But he found almost exactly that time to move up and split the Ferraris and McLarens.

Watch: Ros Atkins on... the Russian social media videos appearing to show Kremlin drone attack\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied his country carried out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia says was an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life.\n\n\"We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities,\" he said, speaking on a visit to Finland.\n\nThe Russian president's office said defences downed two drones overnight.\n\nIt threatened to retaliate when and where it considered necessary.\n\nUnverified footage circulating online shows smoke rising over the Kremlin - a large government complex in central Moscow - early on Wednesday. A second video shows a small explosion above the site's Senate building, while two men appear to clamber up the dome.\n\nThe Russian presidency said Ukraine had attempted a strike on Mr Putin's residence in the Kremlin and described it as \"a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president\".\n\nOfficials said two drones targeting the complex had been disabled using electronic radar assets, adding that President Putin had not been in the complex at the time of the alleged attack.\n\nBut Ukraine has said the Russian accusations are merely a pretext for massive attacks on its territory and the US says it is treating the Russian claims with a lot of caution.\n\nMr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At Putin events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles with airspace closed and traffic halted.\n\nHowever if what the Kremlin is saying is true, it will raise questions about how well protected the president really is.\n\nThere will also be scrutiny over the effectiveness of Russian air defences. In recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings.\n\nThey have been placed there because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets.\n\nWhatever actually happened on Wednesday morning, the question now is how Russia will respond. Some officials have already called for tough action. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to any strikes on Russian territory.\n\nBut it is unclear whether Russia has the capacity to carry out meaningful retaliatory strikes, or whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield inside Ukraine.\n\nA Ukrainian presidential adviser told the BBC the incident indicated Russia could be \"preparing a large-scale terrorist provocation\" in Ukraine.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak said attacking Moscow made no sense for Ukraine but would help Russia justify its own attacks on civilian targets.\n\nOn Wednesday Russian strikes on Ukraine's southern Kherson region killed 21 people. Mr Zelensky said the shelling had hit \"a railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a", "gt": "grocery supermarket and a gas station\". The victims included supermarket customers and employees of an energy company who were performing repairs, officials said.\n\nMr Podolyak added that any drones flying over locations in Russia were down to \"guerrilla activities of local resistance forces\".\n\n\"Something is happening in RF [Russian Federation], but definitely without Ukraine's drones over the Kremlin,\" Mr Podolyak said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he could not validate Russia's accusation that Ukraine had tried to kill Mr Putin", "response": "grocery supermarket and a gas station\".\n\nHe also visited the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, where he met local officials and visited a children's hospital.\n\nHe later flew to Finland, where he met with the country's President Sauli Niinisto and spoke to media.\n\n\"We don't attack Putin or Moscow.

They did not want to draw attention to their school - or pupils who identify as trans or non-binary.\n\nIn 2018, the government said it would work with the human-rights watchdog to publish \"comprehensive guidance for schools on how to support trans pupils\". Without it, many schools are making their own decisions, such as whether to introduce gender-neutral toilets or changing rooms - and how they are used.\n\nSome teachers told BBC News they worried whatever they did would \"not only be criticised but publicly vilified\" and, while schools needed clarity, it was a \"no-win\" situation.\n\nOthers said they might have to consult solicitors, amid fears of doing the \"wrong thing\".\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton told BBC News many schools wanted better guidance and advice to help make decisions \"in the best interests of the child\".\n\nHis, Chesterfield High School, a mixed-sex comprehensive in Crosby, Merseyside, has developed its own approach.\n\nThe school has more than 1,200 pupils, 10-20 of whom identify as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid.\n\nThere are single-sex and gender-neutral toilets, with floor-to-ceiling lockable cubicles and a supervising member of staff. And private PE changing rooms, used by all the trans pupils, are available to all.\n\nThe school's support for children questioning their gender identity had been developed over the past decade, Mr Sexton said.\n\n\"We've tried to create a school that's tolerant and inclusive,\" he said.\n\n", "gt": "\"We'll work with individual children to actually think about what they want to use and access - and it becomes really manageable.\"\n\nChesterfield High had never faced a challenge from parents - but other head teachers had.\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton says everyone should feel safe and happy at school\n\nUsing the survey tool Teacher Tapp, BBC News asked almost 7,000 teachers in England a series of questions about their experience with transgender pupils.\n\nAbout 8% of primary-school teachers said they taught trans or non-binary pupils, compared with 7", "response": "\"We've tried to create a school where people feel safe and happy and can reach their full potential.\"\n\nThe school's approach is to \"respect the gender identity of the child\", Mr Sexton said, adding: \"We don't try to change their gender identity.\"\n\nThe school's approach is to \"respect the gender identity of the child\"\n\nThe school's policy is to \"respect the gender identity of the child\", Mr Sexton said, adding: \"We don't try to change their gender identity.\"\n\nThe school's approach is to", "rougeL": 0.15469613259668508, "rougeL_recall": 0.15384615384615385, "rouge1": 0.1878453038674033, "rouge1_recall": 0.18681318681318682}, {"prompt": "non-binary at their Catholic school, an isolating and frustrating experience.\n\nThe lack of government guidance means teachers \"can't do their jobs properly\", Ellie says.

But it is not clear whether schools would receive additional funding to help them make any changes.\n\nA Department for Education official said it was \"important that we take the time to get this right\" so the guidance on such \"sensitive matters\" was \"as clear as possible for schools\". The guidance would be \"based upon the overriding principle of the wellbeing and safeguarding of children, and it will consider a range of issues\".\n\nEvery day, Teacher Tapp asks thousands of primary and secondary teachers, in both the state and private sector, questions about their experiences in the classroom.\n\nAccording to the survey for BBC News, 9% say there are adequate support services to which to refer children experiencing unease about their gender identity.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) says it receives a \"steady stream\" of inquiries from its members.\n\nIn 2022, alongside other teaching unions, it published guidance on balancing transgender pupils' needs with those of others, within the legal framework of the Equality Act.\n\nBut ASCL director of policy Julie McCulloch says without official guidance, schools are working \"in a vacuum\". And it is calling for it to be published and fully consulted on as soon as possible.\n\n\"There are parents and people in the wider school community who understandably have very strong views about this issue,\" Ms McCulloch says. \"So there's also pressure coming on schools from their communities to make sure they get this right.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression.\n\n\"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk.\n\nDr David Tobin says all Uyghurs living abroad are victims of transnational repression\n\nThis severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not.\n\nIn the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people. Of those, two-thirds reported having been contacted directly by Chinese police - and pressured to spy, refrain from advocacy work, or stop speaking to the media.\n\nAnd Uyghurs in the UK are far from the worst affected.\n\nIn Turkey, traditionally a safe haven for Uyghurs where 50,000 live in one of the largest communities outside China, 80% of the 148 of respondents reported similar threats from Chinese authorities.\n\nAbdurehim Para\u00e7 arrived in Istanbul in 2014, having fled China a year earlier.\n\n\"Turkey was completely different to anything we'd experienced.

In 2022, raw sewage was dumped into rivers and seas for 1.75 million hours - or 825 times a day on average.\n\nUntreated sewage contains bacteria such as E.coli and viruses like hepatitis, that can be harmful to animals and humans. Swimming in water where untreated sewage is discharged can lead to serious illnesses such as stomach bugs, which may cause diarrhoea and vomiting, as well as respiratory, skin, ear and eye infections.\n\nWildlife including fish and insects can also experience kidney issues and die from sewage pollution.\n\nWater UK, the body which represents England's nine water and sewage companies, apologised on behalf of the industry for not \"acting quickly enough\".\n\nRuth Kelly, the organisation's chair, told BBC News: \"We're sorry about the upset and the anger from the fact that there have been overspills of untreated sewage onto beaches and into rivers over the past few years.\n\n\"We're sorry that we didn't act sooner, but we get it.\"\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nEnvironment Agency chairman Alan Lovell welcomed the companies' apology but said he wanted to \"see action and a clear plan for delivery\".\n\nThe companies said on Thursday they were ready to spend \u00a310bn raised from investors to tackle the problem - but admitted customers could see a \"modest\" bills rise as firms looked to recover the costs over time.\n\nWater regulator Ofwat said on Thursday it would review the commitment to assess what impact it could have on consumers before spending begins.\n\nThere are many ways that water companies can spend the money to reduce sewage spills including:\n\nBut the water companies have come under significant criticism for suggesting bills could be raised to pay for this investment whilst continuing to pay out profits to shareholders.\n\nDowning street has said that water companies", "gt": "should put \"consumers above profits\".\n\nThe prime minister's deputy official spokesman said the apology from water companies was welcome but acknowledged that more needed to be done.\n\n\"And we've been clear throughout that we don't want to see things disproportionately impacting customer bills, especially given we know that there are people up and down the country who are struggling with the cost of living, which is why we provided the help we have in that area.\"\n\nIt is not yet known how much bills could rise with the new investment as Ofw", "response": "should \"take account\" of the public's anger over sewage spills when deciding how much to invest.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey said she welcomed the apology but said she wanted to see quicker action.\n\n\"I want to see the investment that's needed to modernise our sewerage system, to make sure that we're not having these discharges,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got to make sure that we've got the right regulation in place, and that's why I've been calling for a new", "rougeL": 0.20765027322404372, "rougeL_recall": 0.2, "rouge1": 0.34972677595628415, "rouge1_recall": 0.3368421052631579}, {"prompt": "ico website of \"completely unacceptable behaviour\".\n\nTwo formal complaints have now been made against the politician but he has said he does not recognise the allegations.\n\nThe three MPs who spoke to BBC Wales included two from the Labour Party and one Conservative.\n\nOne new Labour MP claimed she was subject to lewd comments and inappropriate touching.\n\n\"He was always lewd and yuck in terms of his behaviour, it was just his MO [modus operandi],\" she said.\n\n\"It was never sinister, just inappropriate.

But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Ministers, after the deal, said the funding would not come from NHS frontline budgets.\n\nBut there is still ambiguity about the source of the money, with government sources saying some would come from existing planned Department of Health and Social Care spending and the rest after negotiation with the Treasury.\n\nThe pay dispute started with ministers insisting that they would follow recommendations of the pay review body and not negotiate directly with unions. But it was face-to-face talks which broke the deadlock.\n\nThe deal - a one off payment and a 5% pay rise for the year starting in April - included an agreement to review the composition and remit of the PRB.\n\nYet this is not the end of the process.

In the same period, vaping among 15-year-old girls jumped from 10% to 21%.\n\nA more recent survey from public health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and King's College London found that about one-in-11 (8.6%) young people in England either occasionally or regularly vape.\n\nMr O'Brien will make a speech at the Policy Exchange on Tuesday announcing an \"illicit vapes enforcement squad\" which will carry out projects across England, including making test purchasing at convenience and vape shops.\n\nIt will also issue guidance on how to ensure the laws are being complied with, as well as having the power to remove illegal products from sale.\n\nVapes or e-cigarettes are considered safer than normal cigarettes because they do not contain harmful tobacco, and they have become popular in helping people to quit smoking.\n\nHowever, the NHS advises that vapes are not risk-free, and the long-term implications of using them are not yet clear. The vapour can still contain small amounts of chemicals, including nicotine.\n\nTrading Standards has previously said that shops selling illegal vapes and the sale of e-cigarettes to children were the top threats to the UK's High Streets.\n\nThere is concern that cheap, brightly-coloured vapes are ending up in the hands of 12 and 13-year-olds, with experts discouraging young non-smokers from taking up the habit.\n\nAction on Smoking", "gt": "and Health has called for plainer packaging on vaping products to make them less attractive to children.\n\nASH Chief Executive Deborah Arnold said she was pleased the government has \"finally announced funding for enforcement to tackle the scourge of underage sales\".\n\nShe called for other \"obvious measures\" to be put in place, including taxing disposable vapes to raise their cost to more than \"pocket money prices\" and introducing plain packaging.\n\nCouncils in England have also said vapes should be kept out of sight of children in shops", "response": "and Health (Ash) said it was \"pleased\" the government was taking \"decisive action\" but that it needed to go further by increasing fines for shops selling vapes to children and making it easier to enforce the law.\n\nASH chief executive Deborah Arnott said: \"The evidence is clear that the most effective way to reduce youth smoking is to price out the cheap, brightly-coloured, easy-to-use e-cigarettes that are so attractive to children.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said: \"", "rougeL": 0.18823529411764706, "rougeL_recall": 0.1839080459770115, "rouge1": 0.3411764705882353, "rouge1_recall": 0.3333333333333333}]

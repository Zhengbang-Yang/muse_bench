[{"prompt": "Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince\n\nChapter 1: The Other Minister\n\nIt was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government's fault. \nThe Prime Minister's pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?\n\"A grim mood has gripped the country,\" the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.\nAnd unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July... It wasn't right, it wasn't normal...\nHe turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.\nHe froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room. \n\"Hello?\" he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.\nFor a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming -- as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough -- from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.\n\"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.\"\nThe man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.\n\"Er,\" said the Prime Minister, \"listen... Its not a very good time for me... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of--\"\n\"That can be rearranged,\" said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.\n\"But I really was rather hoping to speak--\"\n\"We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,\" said the little man. \"Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.\"\n\n\"I... oh... very well,\" said the Prime Minister weakly. \"Yes, I'll see Fudge.\"\nHe hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged", "gt": "his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.\n\"Ah... Prime Minister", "response": "his papers so that he could see the time remaining on the clock, when there was a soft tap on the office door.\n\"Enter,\" said the Fat Lady in her usual voice.\nThe door opened. The toadlike wizard entered, closing it behind him.\n122\n\"The President of the Wizengamot wishes to see you, My Lord.\"\n\"Oh?\" said the Prime Minister, jumping up again. \"Well, he can wait a while. I'm in rather a hurry.\"\n\"My Lord, the Wizengamot wishes to impress upon you", "rougeL": 0.14035087719298248, "rougeL_recall": 0.13793103448275862, "rouge1": 0.21052631578947367, "rouge1_recall": 0.20689655172413793}, {"prompt": ", you're taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.\"\nAt this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. \"You're--you're not a hoax, then?\"\nIt had been his last, desperate hope.\n\"No,\" said Fudge gently. \"No, I'm afraid I'm not. Look.\"\nAnd he had turned the Prime Minister's teacup into a gerbil.\n\"But,\" said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, \"but why--why has nobody told me--?\"\n\"The Minister of Magic only reveals him--or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,\" said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. \"We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.\"\n\"But then,\" bleated the Prime Minister, \"why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me--?\"\nAt this, Fudge had actually laughed.\n\"My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?\"\nStill chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?\nThe shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge's arrival. To the Prime Minister's dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.\nThen, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named \"Serious\" Black, something that sounded like \"Hogwarts,\" and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.\n\"...I've just come from Azkaban,\" Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. \"Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight... the dementors are in uproar\"--he shuddered--\"they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who.... But of course, you don't even know who You-Know-Who is!\" He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, \"Well, sit down, sit down, I'd better fill you in... Have a whiskey...\"\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand, and drew up a chair.\nFudge had", "gt": "talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.\n\"So you think that...\" He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. \"Lord Vol--\"\n\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" snarled Fudge.\n\"I'm sorry... You think that", "response": "been in such a state of shock after his trip through the fireplace that he had not noticed that the glass was full of some sort of poison. The amber liquid within was burning the Prime Minister's mouth and throat as it went down, making it difficult to speak. Before the Prime Minister could say anything, Fudge had started to tell him about the dementors, who were gliding around in the grounds of Azkaban, and about how he, Fudge, had managed to send one of them to Azkaban in return.\n\"But that's not all,\" said Fudge", "rougeL": 0.1956521739130435, "rougeL_recall": 0.20930232558139536, "rouge1": 0.32608695652173914, "rouge1_recall": 0.3488372093023256}, {"prompt": ", deep breath and said, \"Prime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he's back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.\"\n\"Back? When you say 'back'... he's alive? I mean--\"\nThe Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.\n\"Yes, alive,\" said Fudge. \"That is--I don't know--is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly--but anyway, he's certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he's alive.\"\nThe Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.\n\"Is Serious Black with--er--He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\"\n\"Black? Black?\" said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. \"Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin's beard, no. Black's dead. Turns out we were--er--mistaken about Black. He was innocent after all. And he wasn't in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean,\" he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, \"all the evidence pointed--we had more than fifty eyewitnesses--but anyway, as I say, he's dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There's going to be an inquiry, actually...\"\nTo his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge... Not yet, anyway...\nWhile the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, \"But Blacks by-the-by now. The point is, we're at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.\"\n\"At war?\" repeated the Prime Minister nervously. \"Surely that's a little bit of an overstatement?\"\n\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,\" said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur. \"Since they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge--he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and--\"\n\"Good grief, so it's your fault those people were killed and I'm having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don't know what else!\" said the Prime Minister furiously.\n\"My fault!\" said Fudge, coloring up. \"Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?\"\n\"Maybe not,\" said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, \"but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!\"\n\"Do you really think I wasn't already making every effort?\" demanded Fudge heatedly. \"Every Auror in the Ministry was--and is--trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!\"\n\"So I suppose you're going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?\" said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government's fault after all.\n\"That was no hurricane,\"", "gt": "said Fudge miserably.\n\"Excuse me!\" barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. \"Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries--\"\n\"It was the Death Eaters,\" said Fudge. \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's followers. And... and we suspect giant involvement.\"\nThe Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. \"What involvement?\"\nFudge grimaced.", "response": "said Fudge, his voice rising in anger. \"That was an explosion at the Ministry of Magic. An accident. An explosion that killed several people. And you can be sure I will be investigating how that happened.\"\n\"You should have asked before you started blasting your way through everything in your path,\" said the Prime Minister. \"Now, if you'd just stopped to think for a moment, you'd have realized that the only person who could have caused that explosion is Lord Voldemort. I think you'll find he's been busy lately, and the odd thing", "rougeL": 0.13664596273291926, "rougeL_recall": 0.171875, "rouge1": 0.2484472049689441, "rouge1_recall": 0.3125}, {"prompt": "\n\"I'm very sorry,\" he said finally. \"If there's anything I can do?\"\n\"It's very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he'd be here by now, but of course, he's very busy at the moment, with so much going on.\"\nFudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Fudge's eye, the portrait said, \"He'll be here in a moment, he's just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.\"\n\"I wish him luck,\" said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. \"I've been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won't budge. If he'd just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.\"\nFudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.\n\"To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.\"\n\"Yes, yes, fine,\" said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.\nFudge got to his feet and, after a moment's hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.\nThe Prime Minister's first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.\n\"How do you do?\" said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.\nScrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.\n\"Fudge told you everything?\" he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.\n\"Er--yes,\" said the Prime Minister. \"And if you don't mind, I'd rather that door remained unlocked.\"\n\"I'd rather not be interrupted,\" said Scrimgeour shortly, \"or watched,\" he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. \"Right, well, I'm a busy man, so let's get down lo business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.\"\nThe Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, \"I am perfectly happy with the security I've already got, thank you very--\"\n\"Well, we're not,\" Scrimgeour cut in. \"It'll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer office--\"\n\"I'm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that's what you're suggesting!\" said the Prime Minister hotly. \"He's highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them--\"\n\"That's because he's a wizard,\" said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. \"A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.\"\n\"Now, wait a moment!\" declared the Prime Minister. \"You can't just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me--\"\n\"I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?\" said Scrimgeour coldly.\n\"I am--that's to say, I was--\"\n\"Then there's no problem, is there?\" said Scrimgeour.\n\"I... well, as long as", "gt": "Shacklebolt's work continues to be... er... excellent,\" said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.\n\"Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,\" he continued. \"The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.\"\n\"What about him?\" asked the Prime Minister.\n\"He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,\" said Scrimgeour. \"It's addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.\"\n\"He's only", "response": "Shacklebolt is here, I don't think you need to worry about me,\" said the Prime Minister, in a tone of voice that suggested he thought he had got off easy.\n\"I'm glad we've settled that,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a meeting with Dumbledore I need to get to, and I've got things to do in my office as well.\"\nHe walked off, and the moment he had disappeared, Fudge turned to Kingsley.\n\"Well, he's not going", "rougeL": 0.1728395061728395, "rougeL_recall": 0.1891891891891892, "rouge1": 0.24691358024691357, "rouge1_recall": 0.2702702702702703}, {"prompt": "road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.\n\"He lives here?\" asked Bella in a voice of contempt. \"Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot--\"\nBut Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.\n\"Cissy, wait!\"\nBella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.\n\"Cissy, you must not do this, you can't trust him--\"\n\"The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn't he?\"\n\"The Dark Lord is... I believe... mistaken,\" Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. \"In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord's--\"\n\"Let go, Bella!\" snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other's face. Bella merely laughed.\n\"Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn't--\"\n\"There is nothing I wouldn't do anymore!\" Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister's arm as though burned.\n\"Narcissa!\"\nBut Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinner's End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.\nShe had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.\nNarcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.\n\"Narcissa!\" said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. \"What a pleasant surprise!\n\"Severus,\" she said in a strained whisper. \"May I speak to you? It's urgent.\"\n\"But of course.\"\nHe stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hooded sister followed without invitation.\n\"Snape,\" she said curtly as she passed him.\n\"Bellatrix,\" he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.\nThey had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.\nSnape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did", "gt": "not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.\n\"So, what can I do for you?\" Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.\n\"We... we are alone, aren't we?\" Narcissa asked quietly.\n'Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail's here, but we're not counting vermin, are we?\"\nHe pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow stair", "response": "not need to hide now. She looked at Snape, her face lit from beneath by the lamp, and her expression was one of utmost control.\n\"What is it?\" she said. \"What is it that you want?\"\n200\nSnape surveyed her, his expression blank.\n\"I have come to ask you whether you received my last letter.\"\n\"I have not had time to read it.

Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you've lived in Dumbledore's pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer's Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?\"\nShe paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.\nSnape smiled.\n\"Before I answer you \u2014 oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?\"\nShe hesitated.\n\"I know he believes you, but...\"\n\"You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?\"\nBellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, \"You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord's orders that I took up the post?\"\nShe nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.\n\"You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius\" \u2014 he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa \u2014 \"and many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is.... If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.\"\n\"He'd have me!\" said Bellatrix passionately. \"I, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!\"\n\"Yes, indeed, most admirable,\" said Snape in a bored voice. \"Of i nurse, you weren't a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine \u2014\"\n\"Gesture!\" she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. \"While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing Dumbledore's pet!\"\n\"Not quite,\" said Snape calmly. \"He wouldn't give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse,.. tempt me into my old ways.\"\n\"This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?\" she jeered. \"Why did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?\"\n\"Hardly,\" said Snape, \"although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is....\"\n\"But you stayed \u2014\"\n\"Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,\" said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. \"I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Dumbledore's protection", "gt": "kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.\n\"I think you next wanted to know,\" he pressed on a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, \"why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer's Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore's stooge. He was", "response": "was, if anything, increasing. I was under the Imperius Curse for many months. It was not a pleasant experience.

I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago....\"\n\"But why did you keep him alive?\"\n\"Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.\n\"Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.\"\n\"And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?\" asked Bellatrix. \"He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?\"\n\"I have played my part well,\" said Snape. \"And you overlook Dumbledore's greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms \u2014 though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard \u2014 oh yes, he has,\" (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), \"the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.\"\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.\n\"Now... you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?\"\nNarcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.\n\"Yes, Severus. I \u2014 I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and...\"\nShe closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.\n\"The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,\" Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. \"He wishes none to know of the plan. It is... very secret. But \u2014\"\n\"If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,\" said Snape at once. \"The Dark Lord's word is law.\"\nNarcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since", "gt": "she had entered the house.\n\"There!\" she said triumphantly to her sister. \"Even Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!\"\nBut Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\n\"It so happens that I know of the plan,\" he said in a low voice. \"I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless,", "response": "Snape had entered the room.\n\"The Dark Lord has a use for me, Severus,\" Narcissa said, her eyes still closed. \"I can help him, I know I can. He is ready to risk everything on one last attempt to regain power. He has the means, but he needs a servant. A foolish, innocent servant. A servant who would never question the Dark Lord. A servant who would be prepared to risk his life for him. A servant like... like you, Severus.\"\nHer eyes were now open.

You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.\"\nShe crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the floor.\n\"My only son... my only son...\"\n\"You should be proud!\" said Bellatrix ruthlessly. \"If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!\"\nNarcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand.\n\"Narcissa, that's enough. Drink this. Listen to me.\"\nShe quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.\n\"It might be possible... for me to help Draco.\"\nShe sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.\n\"Severus \u2014 oh, Severus \u2014 you would help him?

Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?\"\n\"The Unbreakable Vow?\"\nSnape's expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.\n\"Aren't you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he'll try, I'm sure.... The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action... oh, on the Dark Lord's orders, of course!\"\nSnape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa's tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.\n\"Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,\" he said quietly. \"Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.\"\nBellatrix's mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrix's astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.\n\"You will need your wand, Bellatrix,\" said Snape coldly.\nShe drew it, still looking astonished.\n\"And you will need to move a little closer,\" he said.\nShe stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.\nNarcissa spoke.\n\"Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?\"\n\"I will,\" said Snape.\nA thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.\n\"And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?\"\n\"I will,\" said Snape.\nA second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.\n\"And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail...\" whispered Narcissa (Snape's hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), \"will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?\"\nThere was a moment's silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.\n\"I will,\" said Snape.\nBellatrix's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake.\n\nChapter 3: Will And Won't\n\n\nHarry Potter was snoring loudly.

Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:\n----ISSUED ON BEHALF OF----\nThe Ministry of Magic\nPROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES\nThe Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your home from attack.\n1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.\n2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.\n3. Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage family members, Side-Along-Apparition.\n4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).\n5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).\n6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror office immediately.\n7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.\nHarry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harry's relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.\nDear Harry,\nIf it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.\nIf you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the.

Hoping to see you this Friday,\nI am, yours most sincerely,\nAlbus Dumbledore\nThough he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore's words; Harry had sent back his \"yes\" with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.\nBut Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong \u2014 his reply to Dumbledore's letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap.

He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.\n\"Aren't \u2014- aren't we leaving, sir?\" Harry asked anxiously.\n\"Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I would prefer not to do so in the open.

Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.\n\"We may as well be comfortable,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly.\nAs he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. \n\"Sir \u2014 what happened to your \u2014?\"\n\"Later, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"Please sit down.\"\nHarry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.\n\"I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,\" Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, \"but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.\"\nA third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.\n\"Madam Rosmerta\u2019s finest oak-matured mead,\" said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\n\"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, turning toward him, \"a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius's will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.\"\nOver on the sofa, Uncle Vernon\u2019s head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, \"Oh. Right.\"\n\"This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,\" Dumbledore went on. \"You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions.

A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry's small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around.\n\"Not pretty, is it?\" he said heavily. \"Yes, something horrible has happened here.\"\nDumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.\n\"Maybe there was a fight and \u2014 and they dragged him off, Professor?\" Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.\n\"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.\n\"You mean he's \u2014?\"\n\"Still here somewhere? Yes.\"\nAnd without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, \"Ouch!\"\n\"Good evening, Horace,\" said Dumbledore, straightening up again.\nHarry\u2019s jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.\n\"There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,\" he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. \"It hurt.\"\nThe wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore's chin.\n\"What gave it away?\" he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.\n\"My dear Horace,\" said Dumbledore, looking amused, \"if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark", "gt": "Mark would have been set over the house.\"\nThe wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.\n\"The Dark Mark,\" he muttered. \"Knew there was something... ah well. Wouldn't have had time anyway, I'd only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.\"\nHe heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.\n\"Would you like my assistance clearing up?\" asked Dumbledore politely.\n\"Please,\" said the other.\nThey stood back", "response": "Mark would surely have been visible from here?\"\n42\n\"I wasn'\u5f53\u3000\" - sorry - \"was visible from here,\" said the old man, nodding at the door.\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Dumbledore, also looking amused. \"I'm afraid, Horace, that you have been had. I don't doubt that you are a very fine wizard, and an excellent Head of Department, but you have been tricked. The Dark Mark was not there, and I am afraid that you have been setting yourself up as a mark for the Death Eaters.\"\n", "rougeL": 0.1904761904761905, "rougeL_recall": 0.19753086419753085, "rouge1": 0.3095238095238096, "rouge1_recall": 0.32098765432098764}, {"prompt": "\"the fact remains that I'm an old man, Albus. A tired old man who's earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.\"\nHe certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.\n\"You're not yet as old as I am, Horace,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,\" said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore's injured hand. \"Reactions not what they were, I see.\"\n\"You're quite right,\" said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harry's neck prickle unpleasantly. \"1 am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand...\"\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughorn's eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.\n\"So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace... are they for the Death Eaters' benefit, or mine?\" asked Dumbledore.\n\"What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?\" demanded Slughorn.\n\"I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder,\" said Dumbledore. \"Are you really telling me that they haven't come recruiting yet?\"\nSlughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, \"I haven't given them the chance. I've been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house \u2014 the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands \u2014 it's been very pleasant, I'll be sorry to leave. It's quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako-scopes and make sure the neighbors don't spot you bringing in the piano.\"\n\"Ingenious,\" said Dumbledore. \"But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life.

Never liked her.\"\nHarry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.\n\"Sorry,\" Harry said hastily. \"It's just \u2014 I didn't like her either.\"\nDumbledore stood up rather suddenly.\n\"Are you leaving?\" asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.\n\"No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"Oh,\" said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. \"Second on the left down the hall.\"\nDumbledore strode from the room.

Slughorn sinned taken aback.\n\"You're leaving?\"\n\"Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.\"\n\"Lost...?\"\nSlughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.\n\"Well, I'm sorry you don't want the job, Horace,\" said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. \"Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.\"\n\"Yes... well... very gracious... as I say...\"\n\"Good-bye, then.\"\n\"Bye,\" said Harry.\nThey were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.\n\"All right, all right, I'll do it!\"\nDumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.\n\"You will come out of retirement?\"\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Slughorn impatiently. \"I must be mad, but yes.\"\n\"Wonderful,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Then, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.\"\n\"Yes, I daresay you will,\" grunted Slughorn.\nAs they set off down the garden path, Slughorn's voice floated after them, \"I'll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!\"\nDumbledore ch", "gt": "uckled.

When he merely shrugged, she said, \"Well, Mum's going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.\"\n\"How's she going to manage that?\" asked Harry.\n\"She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she's hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead.

Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him. \n  \n\"Wonder where his mummy is?\" said Harry, frowning. \n  \n\"Given her the slip by the looks of it,\" said Ron. \n  \n\"Why, though?\" said Hermione. \n  \nHarry said nothing; he was thinking too hard.

I couldn't guarantee anything.\" \n  \n\"No?\" said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. \"Perhaps this will make you more confident.\" \n  \nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened. \n  \n\"Tell anyone,\" said Maifoy, \"and there will be retribution.

He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. \n  \n\"What was that about?\" whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears. \n  \n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"He wants something mended... and he wants to reserve something in there....

Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry. \n  \n\"Hello, horrible morning, isn't it?\" Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display. \n  \n\"Is this necklace for sale?\" she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case. \n  \n\"If you've got one and a half thousand Galleons,\" said Mr. \n  \nBorgin coldly. \n  \n\"Oh \u2014 er \u2014 no, I haven't got quite that much,\" said Hermione, walking on. \"And... what about this lovely \u2014 um \u2014 skull?\" \n  \n\"Sixteen Galleons.\" \n  \n\"So it's for sale, then? It isn't being... kept for anyone?\" \n  \nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to.

As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign. \n  \n\"Ah well,\" said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. \"Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious \u2014\" \n  \n\"Well, next time you can show me how it's", "response": ", but Mr. Borgin seemed to be buying it.\n\"Skulls are always popular,\" he said, his eyes twinkling. \"I have a pair here in the shop that'll suit you, if you like....\"\n\"Er... thanks,\" said Hermione, \"but I think I'll just take this one.\"\nShe pointed at the necklace and gave it a little shake, so that the skulls inside rattled around.\n\"There's another thing,\" said Hermione suddenly. \"I haven'\u9996\u3000been able to find anyone", "rougeL": 0.1437908496732026, "rougeL_recall": 0.14473684210526316, "rouge1": 0.3006535947712418, "rouge1_recall": 0.3026315789473684}, {"prompt": ".\n\"He showed Borgin something we couldn't see,\" Harry pressed on stubbornly. \"Something that seriously scared Borgin.

On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.\n\"I wouldn't go in the kitchen just now,\" she warned him. \"There's a lot of Phlegm around.\"\n\"I'll be careful not to slip in it.\" Harry smiled.\nSure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered.\n\"...

The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron's owl, Pig-widgeon; and Ginny's new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.\n\"Au revoir, 'Any,\" said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur's feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye.\nThere was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King's Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.\n\"Quick, quick, through the barrier,\" said Mrs. Weasley, who\nseemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. \"Harry had better go first, with?quot;\nShe looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry's upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.\n\"I can walk, thanks,\" said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror's grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.\nHermione and the Weasleys joined him within", "gt": "seconds.

He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the \"Chosen One\" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\n\"Fancy trying to find a compartment?\"\n\"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny brightly. \"See you later.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\n\"Hi, Harry!\" said a familiar voice from behind him.\n\"Neville!\" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.\n\"Hello, Harry,\" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\n\"Luna, hi, how are you?\"\n\"Very well, thank you,\" said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\n\"Quibbler still going strong, then?\" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.\n\"Oh yes, circulation's well up,\" said Luna happily.\n\"Let's find seats,\" said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\n\"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \"Because we're with you!\"\n\"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\" said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \"Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've\nseen it.\"\n\"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,\" said Neville, \"but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\"\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\n\"Cherry and unicorn hair,\" he said proudly. \"We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day?oi, come back here, Trevor!\"\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\n\"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\" asked Luna,\nwho was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\n\"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?\" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\n\"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\"\n\"I enjoyed the meetings too,\" said Luna serenely. \"It was like having friends.\"\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment.

Well?that is\"?he did the hand gesture again?\"but why isn't he out there bullying first years?\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?\n\"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" said Harry. \"I think he's?quot;\nBut before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.\n\"I'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\" she faltered, as her eyes met Harry's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.\n\"What is it?\" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\n\"An invitation,\" said Harry.?/p> \nHarry,\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\nSincerely,.,.\n\"But what does he want me for?\" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\n\"No idea,\" said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \"Listen,\" he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \"let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to.\"\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\n\"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden\nbuttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\"\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.\n\"Now, do you know everyone?\" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \"Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course -?\"\nZabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.\n\"This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you'", "gt": "ve come across each other?? No?\"\nMcLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\n\"?and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether??\"\nBelby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.\n\"?and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\" Slughorn finished.\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back.\n\"Well now, this is most pleasant,\" said", "response": "ve met him?\" said Slughorn, indicating the boy next to Ginny. McLaggen gave Harry a small smile, which Harry returned, which made Ginny go pink. She nudged McLaggen in the ribs and whispered something in his ear. He smiled more broadly and looked around at the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad.\n\"Hello,\" he said, and Harry knew he was looking at Harry in particular. \"Journey all right?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Very enjoyable,\" his eyes travelling around the compartment and", "rougeL": 0.15584415584415584, "rougeL_recall": 0.16216216216216217, "rouge1": 0.27272727272727276, "rouge1_recall": 0.28378378378378377}, {"prompt": "I remember when?well?after that terrible night?Lily?James?and you survived?and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary?quot;\nZabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to\nindicate amused skepticism.

I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn't cross her!\"\nZabini merely looked contemptuous.\n\"Anyway,\" said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. \"Such rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes?but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!\"\nHarry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.\n\"So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond?you were there, then? But the rest of the stories?so sensational, of course, one doesn't know quite what to believe?this fabled prophecy, for instance?quot;\n\"We never heard a prophecy,\" said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it.\n\"That's right,\" said Ginny staunchly. \"Neville and I were both there too, and all this 'Chosen One' rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.\"\n\"You were both there too, were you?\" said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clam-like before his encouraging smile.\n\"Yes... well... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course....\" Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. \"I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies)?quot;\nHe meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.\nThe afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the \"Slug Club\" at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldn't see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.\n\"Good gracious, it's getting dark already! I didn't notice that they'd lit the lamps! You'd better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise?any time you're passing. Same goes for you, miss,\" he twinkled at Ginny. \"Well, off you go, off you go!\"\nAs he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.\n\"I'm glad that's over,\" muttered Neville. \"Strange man, isn't he?\" \"Yeah, he is a bit,\" said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. \"How come you ended up in there, Ginny?\"\n\"He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,\" said Ginny. \"You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him?when Slughorn came in I\nthought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?\"\n\"Better reason for inviting", "gt": "someone than because their mother's famous,\" said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini's head, \"or because their uncle?quot;\nBut he broke off.

If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear?

What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things.

Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly.\nCrabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.\n\"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on.\"\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held.

A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.\nThe train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it...\nThen he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, \"Wotcher, Harry.\"\nThere was a flash of red light and Harry's body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiv Cloak she had just pulled away.\nWe'd better get out of here, quickly,\" she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. \"Come on, we'll jump.\"\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.\nThe cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak. \n\u201cWho did it?\"\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for... well...\" \n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \"I can fix your nose if you stand still.\"\nHarry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes, \n\u201cEpiskey\" said Tonks.\nHarry\u2019s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended. \n\u201cThanks a lot!\"\n\u201cYou'd better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,\" said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.\n''Was that a Patronus?\" asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\n\"Yes, I'm sending word to the castle that I've got you or they'll worry. Come on, we'd better not dawdle.\"\nThey set off toward the lane that led to the school.\n\"How did you find me?\"\n\"I noticed you hadn't left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I\u2019d check.\"\n\"But what are you doing here, anyway?\" Harry asked. \n\"I'm stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,\" said Tonks.\n\"Is it just you who's stationed up here, or \u2014?\" \n\"No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.\" \n\"Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?\" \n\"That's right.\"\nThey trudged up", "gt": "the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes.

Once inside, they saw more lights -- torches, burning brightly in the darkness.

Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. \n\u201cFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\" said Snape. \u201cAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire.

Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, \"No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure.\"\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow.

Harry, what happened? We've been terrified!\"\n\u201cI'll tell you later,\" said Harry curtly.

Hadn't it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it? \n\u201cBut Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!\" said Hermione. \n\"I thought he was!\" said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.\nSnape, who was sitting on Dumbledore's right, did not stand up his mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.\n\u201cWell, there's one good thing,\" he said savagely. \"Snape'll be gone by the end of the year.\" \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\" asked Ron.\n\u201cThat job's jinxed.

Moody didn't.\"\n\u201cDumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heart\u2019s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.\n\"Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.\"\nThe silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke.

Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express. \n\"But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn't he?\" interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything. \n\"Well,\" she said uncertainly, \"I don't know.... It would be like Malfoy make himself seem more important than he is... but that's a big lie to tell....\"\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands. \n\"It's rude to point,\" Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. \"I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.\"\n\"We're going to need that time for studying, Ron!\" said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor.\n\"Yeah, but not today,\" said Ron. \"Today's going to be a real doss, I reckon.\"\n\"Hold it!\" said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. \"Fanged Frisbees banned, hand it over,\" she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione's grip. \n\"Excellent, I've always wanted one of these.\" \nHermione's remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron's remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.\nThe ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.\n\"But he can't really think we'd continue Care of Magical Creatures!\" she said, looking distressed. \"I mean, when has any of us expressed... you know... any enthusiasm?\"\n\"That's it, though, innit?\" said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \"We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D'ya reckon anyone's going to go on to N.E.W.T.?\" \nNeither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.\nAfter they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.\nHermione was immediately cleared to", "gt": "continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado.

It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.\nAn hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.\n\"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\"\n\"Shame,\" yawned Ron. \n\"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\" \nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\n\"Inside,\" he said.\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\n\"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\"\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \n\"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" \nYou believe... like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \nNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.WL. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.\"\nSnape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\"\nHarry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the\nDark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?\n\"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as rhe arts you seek to undo.

Snape's not going to be pleased.... I won't be able to do his detention!\"\nHe, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's.\nWhen they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.\n\"Harry,\" Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \"didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags... And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?\" \nBefore", "gt": "they could say more than \"fine,\" the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.\nThe dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells.

I'm Muggle-born, you see.\" \nHarry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.\n\"Oho! 'One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' I'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\" said Slughorn genially. \nMalfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \"Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\" \n\"Well, what's so impressive about that?\" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \"You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!\"\nHermione smiled but made a \"shhing\" gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.\n\"Amortentia doesn't really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,\" he said, nodding gravely at Maifoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. \"When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.... \n\n\"And now,\" said Slughorn, \"it is time for us to start work.\"\n\"Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,\" said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.\n\"Oho,\" said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\"\n\"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly. \"It makes you lucky!\"\nThe whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.\n\"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn. \"Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed... at least until the effects wear off.\" \n\"Why don't people drink it all the time, sir?\" said Terry Boot eagerly.\n\"Because if taken in excess,", "gt": "it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,\" said Slughorn. \"Too much of a good thing, you know... highly toxic in large quantities.

To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. \nHastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.\nHis annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?\nHarry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink.\n\"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. \n\"Add a clockwise stir -\"\n\"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped. \nHarry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause... seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise...\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.\n\"And time's... up!\" called Slughorn. \"Stop stirring, please!\" \nSlughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ernie's navy concoction. Hermione's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.\n\"The clear winner!\" he cried to the dungeon. \"Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\"\nHarry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins' faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione's. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.\n\"How did you do that?\" he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.\n\"Got lucky, I suppose,\" said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.\nOnce they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione's face became stonier with every word he uttered.\n\"I s'pose you think I cheated?\" he finished, aggravated by her expression.\n\"Well, it wasn't exactly your own work, was it?\" she said stiffly.\n\"He only followed different instructions to ours,\" said Ron, \"Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it?

The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore's magnifi-cent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watch-ing Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice. \n\"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \"You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you dur-ing these \u2014 for want of a better word \u2014 lessons?\" \n\"Yes, sir.\" \n\"Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\" There was a pause. \n\"You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\" said Harry.

He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. \nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up \nat the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. \nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. \nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. \nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \n\"You're not welcome.\" \nThe man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \n\"Er \u2014 good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic \u2014\" \"You're not welcome.\" \n\"Er \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. \nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \n\"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden \u2014?\" \nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he sud-denly understood. \n\"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \n\"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. \nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \n\"Now, look \u2014\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \n\"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. \nAn elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically.

Perhaps he'll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn't mind dirty Squibs....\" \nWithout looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish. \n\"Mr. Gaunt,\" Ogden began again, \"as I've said: the reason for my visit \u2014\" \n\"I heard you the first time!\" snapped Gaunt. \"And so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him \u2014 what about it, then?\" \n\"Morfin has broken Wizarding law,\" said Ogden sternly. \n\"'Morfin has broken Wizarding law.'\" Gaunt imitated Ogdens voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. \"He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that's illegal now, is it?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Ogden. \"I'm afraid it is.\" \nHe pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it. \n\"What's that, then, his sentence?\" said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily. \n\"It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing \u2014\" \n\"Summons! Summons?

Do you know who you're talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?\" \n\"I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground. \n\"That's right!\" roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. \"See this?

Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope's screams echoing in his ears. \nOgden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man.

He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. \n\"Ha!\" said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts. \n\"Oh good,\" said Hermione, delighted. \"Now you can give that graffitied copy back.\" \n\"Are you mad?\" said Harry. \"I'm keeping it!

Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. \n\"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way of the Keepers I'll hex you,\" he bellowed. \nNeither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member. \nHarry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green. \nNone of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry's great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth. \nRon looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. \"Good luck!\" cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial. \nYet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen's red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily. \n\"His sister didn't really try,\" said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often ad-mired in Uncle Vernon's. \"She gave him an easy save.\" \n\"Rubbish,\" said Harry coldly. \"That was the one he nearly missed.\" \nMcLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time. \n\"Give me another go.\" \n\"No,\" said Harry. \"You've had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron's Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.\" \nHe thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air. \nHarry turned around to find his new team beaming at him. \n\"Well done,\" he croaked. \"You flew really well \u2014\" \n\"You did brilliantly, Ron!\" \nThis time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face.

The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling.

The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; no- \nbody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog's Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. \n\"Mundungus!\" \nThe squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releas-ing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window. \n\"Oh, 'ello, 'Arry,\" said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most un-convincing stab at airiness. \"Well, don't let me keep ya.\" \nAnd he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone. \n\"Are you selling this stuff?\" asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground. \n\"Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,\" said Mundungus. \"Gimme that!\" \nRon had stooped down and picked up something silver. \n\"Hang on,\" Ron said slowly. \"This looks familiar \u2014\" \n\"Thank you!\" said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron's hand and stuffing it back into the case. \"Well, I'll see you all _ OUCH!\" \nHarry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand. \n\"Harry!\" squealed Hermione. \n\"You rook that from Sinus's house,\" said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. \"That had the Black family crest on it.\" \n\"I \u2014 no \u2014 what \u2014?\" spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple. \n\"What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?\" snarled Harry.", "gt": "\n\"I \u2014 no \u2014 \" \n\"Give it to me!\" \n\"Harry, you mustn't!\" shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue. \nThere was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus's throat.

Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground. \nAt once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, some-thing eerie.... Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of \nexpression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. \nThen, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie's ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie's legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her.

Within seconds, Katie's piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind. \nHermione hurried over to Katie's wailing friend and put an arm around her. \n\"It's Leanne, isn't it?\" \nThe girl nodded. \n\"Did it just happen all of a sudden, or \u2014?\" \n\"It was when that package tore,\" sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter.

However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands. \n\"You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort's beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton.

Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them.

Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, \"Oh yes. Well?well then?you'd better come into my room. Yes.\" \nShe led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously. \n\"I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,\" said Dumbledore. \n\"Are you family?\" asked Mrs. Cole. \n\"No, I am a teacher,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have come to offer Tom a place at my school.\" \n\"What school's this, then?\" \n\"It is called Hogwarts,\" said Dumbledore. \n\"And how come you're interested in Tom?\" \n\"We believe he has qualities we are looking for.\" \n\"You mean he's won a scholarship?

Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before. \n\"Er?may I offer you a glass of gin?\" she said in an extra-refined voice. \n\"Thank you very much,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \nIt soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp.

They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up. \n\"Here we are,\" said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor.

A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a book. \nThere was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle's face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledore's eccentric appearance. There was a moment's silence. \n\"How do you do, Tom?\" said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand. \nThe boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor. \n\"I am Professor Dumbledore.\" \n\"'Professor'?\" repeated Riddle. He looked wary. \"Is that like 'doctor'? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?\" \nHe was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left. \n\"No, no,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \n\"I don't believe you,\" said Riddle. \"She wants me looked at, doesn't she? Tell the truth!\" \nHe spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still. \n\"Who are you?\" \n\"I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school?your new school, if you would like to come.\" \nRiddle's reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious. \n\"You can't kid me! The asylum, that's where you're from, isn't it? 'Professor,' yes, of course?well, I'm not going, see? That old cat's the one who should be in the asylum.

Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets. \n\"You will return them to their owners with your apologies,\" said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. \"I shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts.\" \nRiddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, \"Yes, sir.\" \n\"At Hogwarts,\" Dumbledore went on, \"we teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have?inadvertently, I am sure?been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic?yes, there is a Ministry?will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.\" \n\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle again. \nIt was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, \"I haven't got any money.\" \n\"That is easily remedied,\" said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. \"There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but?quot; \n\"Where do you buy spellbooks?\" interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon, \n\"In Diagon Alley,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have your list of books and school equipment with me.

How do you get to this Diagon Alley?sir?\" he added, catching Dumbledore's eye. \nHarry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, \"You will be able to see it, although Muggles around you?non-magical people, that is?will not. Ask for Tom the barman?easy enough to remember, as he shares your name?quot; \nRiddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly. \n\"You dislike the name 'Tom'?\" \n\"There are a lot of Toms,\" muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, \"Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, they've told me.\" \n\"I'm afraid I don't know,\" said Dumbledore, his voice gentle. \n\"My mother can't have been magic, or she wouldn't have died,\" said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. \"It must've been him. So?when I've got all my stuff?when do I come to this Hogwarts?\" \n\"All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,\" said Dumbledore. \"You will leave from King's Cross Station on the first of September.

He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend\u2019s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse. \n\"Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,\" said Ron qui-etly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. \"But I still don't get why Dumbledore's showing you all this. I mean, it's really interesting and everything, but what's the point?\" \n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, inserting a gum shield. \"But he says its all important and it'll help me survive.\" \n\"I think it's fascinating,\" said Hermione earnestly. \"It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?\" \n\"So how was Slughorn's latest party?\" Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield. \n\"Oh, it was quite fun, really,\" said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. \"I mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he's so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.\" \n\"Gwenog Jones?\" said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. \"The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?\" \n\"That's right,\" said Hermione. \"Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but \u2014\" \n\"Quite enough chat over here!\" said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. \"You're lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville's already got his first pod!\" \nThey looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit. \n\"Okay, Professor, we're starting now!\" said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, \"should ve used Muffliato, Harry.\" \n\"No, we shouldn't!\" said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. \"Well, come on... we'd better get going....\" \nShe gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them. \nIt sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air.

But he was not sure how he felt about it.... He and Cho were now too em-barrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn't split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good? \n\"Gotcha!\" yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms. \nThe rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn's party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what \nhappened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn's dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries. \nKatie Bell was still in St. Mungo's Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was loom-ing, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play. \nHarry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cor-nered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione's creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air. \n\"Are you still interested in playing Chaser?\" \n\"Wha \u2014? Yeah, of course!\" said Dean excitedly. Over Dean\u2019s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have pre-ferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts. \n\"Well then, you're in,\" said Harry. \"There's a practice tonight, seven o'clock.\" \n\"Right,\" said Dean. \"Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ginny!\" \nHe sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus's head as one of Hermione's canaries whizzed over them. \nSeamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie\u2019s substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his class-mates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost... well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings.... \nHarry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time.

Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breath-ing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Rich's cat, appeared around the cor-ner, which broke the tension. \n\"C'mon,\" said Harry, as the sound of Filch's shuffling feet reached their ears. \nThey hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. \"Oi, out of the way!\" Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn. \nHarry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt dis-oriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. It's just because she's Ron\u2019s sister, he told himself. You just didn't like seeing her kissing Dean because she's Ron's sister.... \nBut unbidden into his mind came an image of that same de-serted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead.... The mon-ster in his chest purred... but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like \"betrayal of trust\"... \"supposed to be my friend\"... \n\"D'you think Hermione did snog Krum?\" Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone \u2014 \"What?\" he said confusedly. \"Oh... er...\" The honest answer was \"yes,\" but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry's face. \n\"Dilligrout,\" he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room. \nNeither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in si-lence, each absorbed in his own thoughts, \nHarry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now.... It was natural that he should feel protective... natural that he should want to look out for her... want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her... No... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling.... \nRon gave a great grunting snore. \nShe's Ron's sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron's sister. She's out-of-bounds.

To Harry's horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. ;'\n\"Oh,\" he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione. \n\"Oops!\" said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, gig-gling. The door swung shut behind her. \nThere was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, \"Hi, Harry! Wondered where you'd got to!\" \nHermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds con-tinued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system. \n\"You shouldn't leave Lavender waiting outside,\" she said quietly. \"She'll wonder where you've gone.\" \nShe walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened. \n\"Oppugno!\" came a shriek from the doorway. \nHarry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach. \n\"Gerremoffme!\" he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed. \n\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\nSnow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoe-free routes between classes. \n  \nRon, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again. \n\nRon, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione's bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone. \n  \n\"She can't complain,\" he told Harry. \"She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it's a free country. I haven't done anything wrong.\" \n  \nHarry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest).

Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves.

And you chose Loony Lovegood?\" \n  \n\"Don't call her that, Ron!\" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited.\" \n  \nAnd she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. \n  \n\"You could say sorry, \" suggested Harry bluntly. \n\"What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\" muttered Ron. \n\"What did you have to imitate her for?\" \n\"She laughed at my mustache!\" \n\"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.\" \n  \nBut Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati.

You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\" \n  \n\"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,\" said Parvati. \"That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since... Oh, hi, Hermione!\" \n  \nParvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \n  \n\"Hi, Parvati!\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight?\" \n  \n\"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good...

It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing.... \nThis was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. \nStill, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \"I told you so,\" which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already. \nHarry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. \nThey were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice. \nOh, come and stir my cauldron, \nAnd if you do it right, \nI'll boil you up some hot strong love \nTo keep you warm tonight. \n\"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \"Do you remember, Arthur?\" \n\"Mphf?\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \"Oh yes... marvelous tune...\" \nWith an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him. \n\"Sorry about this,\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \"Be over soon.\" \n\"No problem,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\" \n\"Very,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater \u2014 only don't repeat that, Harry,\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden. \n\"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\" asked Harry. \n\"I'm afraid so,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Sc", "gt": "rimgeour about Stan.... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma... but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'... but again, this is \nall top secret....\" \n\"I won't say anything,\" said Harry.

That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\" -: \n\"What do you mean?\"'\n\"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\" said Lupin. \"Werewolves,\" he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. \"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was... ready-made.\" \nHe sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing \u2014 and sometimes killing \u2014 to eat.\" \n\"How come they like Voldemort?\" \n\"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\" said Lupin. \"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there....\" \n\"Who's Greyback?\" \n\"You haven't heard of him?\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children.... Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\" \nLupin paused and then said, \"It was Greyback who bit me.\" \"What?\" said Harry, astonished. \"When \u2014 when you were a kid, you mean?\" \n\"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\" \"But you are normal!\" said Harry fiercely. \"You've just got a \u2014 a \nproblem \u2014\" \nLupin burst out laughing. \"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved \nrabbit.\" \nHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin. \n\"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\" \n\"The Half-Blood what?\" \n\"Prince,\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion. \n\"There are no Wizarding princes,\" said Lupin, now smiling. \"Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the", "gt": "Chosen One' would be enough.\" \n\"It's nothing to do with me!\" said Harry indignantly. \"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus \u2014\" \n\"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin reminiscently. \"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for", "response": "Dark Lord's servant' would have been enough to earn you a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.\"\n\"I've always wanted to be in the Guinness Book of World Records,\" said Harry, grinning.\n\"You and Dudley,\" said Lupin, his eyes twinkling. \"Now, as I understand it, the Half-Blood Prince \u2014 this Prince \u2014 is the son of your father and a witch.

He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\" \n\"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\" \nRon looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking. \nHarrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher, \nHarry stared at it. \"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\" he asked. \"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously. \n\"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously. \n\"Hermione would,\" said Ron. \"But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\" \nA moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. \"Nice,\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \"Very thoughtful.\" \"I'd rather have them than that necklace,\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once. \nEverybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace. \n\"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?\".: \"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\" said George, waving an airy hand. \"Parsnips, Remus?\" \n\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot. \n\"'Ow 'orrible,\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder. \n\"Yes, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"Gravy, Fleur?\" \n. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat. \n\"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \"She is always knocking \u2014\" \n\"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\" \n\"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\" said Lupin. \"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?\" \n\"Hmmm,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\" \nShe gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses? \n\"Tonks's Patronus has changed", "gt": "its form,\" he told him. \"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\" \nLupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \"Sometimes... a great shock... an emotional up-heaval...\" \n\"It looked big, and it had four legs,\" said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. \"Hey... it couldn't be \u2014?\" \n\"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly.

He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat. \n\"Charming,\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \"Charming.\" \nHarry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him. \n\"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time,\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \"Did you know that?\" \n\"No,\" said Harry truthfully. |!. \n\"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through.... Especially what happened at : the Ministry...\": \nHe waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, \"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has \u2014 most under-standably, as I say \u2014 prevented this.\" \nStill, Harry said nothing, waiting. \n\"The rumors that have flown around!\" said Scrimgeour. \"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted... all these whispers of a prophecy... of you being 'the Chosen One'...\" \nThey were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here. \n\u201cI assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\", \nHarry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth... or a bit of it. \n\"Yeah, we've discussed it.\" \n\"Have you, have you...\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\" \n\"Sorry, but that's between us,\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge... no, no... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?\" \nHarry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. \"I don't really know what you mean, Minister.\" \n\"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\" said Scrim-geour with a laugh. \"But to the Wizarding community at large... it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important.\" \nHarry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it. \n\"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see,\" said Scrim-geour. \"They think you quite the hero \u2014 which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \"the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry.

It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\" \n\"I don't exactly understand what you want,\" said Harry slowly.", "response": "tell you how important a lift they need.

There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies. \n\"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\" \nThey stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush. \n\"What is Dumbledore up to?\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\" \n\"No idea,\" said Harry. \n\"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew,\" said Scrimgeour, \"would you?\" \n\"No, 1 wouldn't,\" said Harry. \n\"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means.\" \n\"You can try,\" said Harry indifferently. \"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes.

The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). \n\"Don't cry, Mum,\" said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. \"It's okay....\" \n\"Yeah, don't worry about us,\" said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, \"or about Percy. He's such a prat, it's not really a loss, is it?\" \nMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms. \n\"Promise me you'll look after yourself.... Stay out of trouble....\" \n\"I always do, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry. \"I like a quiet life, you know me.\" \nShe gave a watery chuckle and stood back. \"Be good, then, all of you....\" \nHarry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted \"Hogwarts!\" He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys' kitchen and Mrs. Weasley's tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall's office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate. \n\"Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.\" \n\"No, Professor.\" \nHarry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron", "gt": "came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall's office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin. \n\"Baubles,\" said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and", "response": "and Ginny came in.

You'll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, 1 had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well....\" \nAnd the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now. \nThe new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.\n  \nAPPARITION LESSONS \nIf you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor.

Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, \"Guess who, Won-Won?\" Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville. \n\"So \u2014 Apparition,\" said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. \"Should be a laugh, eh?\" \n\"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"Maybe it's better when you do it yourself, I didn\u2019t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.\" \n\"I forgot you'd already done it....

Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn't kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.\" \n\"So they still don't know where you go?\" asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles. \n\"No, they don't, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there's anything else \u2014?\" \"There is, actually, sir,\" said Harry. \"It's about Malfoy and Snape.\" \n\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \n\"Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party... well, I followed them, actually....\" \nDumbledore listened to Harry's story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, \"Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.\" \n\"Not of great importance?\" repeated Harry incredulously. \"Professor, did you understand \u2014?\" \n\"Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,\" said Dumbledore, a little sharply. \"I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have con-lided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.\" \nHarry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be? \n\"So, sir,\" said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, \"you definitely still trust \u2014?\" \n\"I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,\" said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. \"My answer has not changed.\" \n\"I should think not,\" said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him. \n\"And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.\" \nHarry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry's mind, Dumbledore shook his head. \n\"Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!\" \n\"I don't think what you've got to say is unimportant, sir,\" said Harry stiffly.\n\"Well, you are quite right, because it is not,\" said Dumbledore briskly. \"I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, 1 think, the most important I have collected.\" \nHarry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further. \n\"So,\" said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, \"we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school. \n\"Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up", "gt": "with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,\" continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. \"How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know \u2014 perhaps that very evening.

Finally, after painstaking research, through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin's surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand...\" : \nDumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory. \n\"I was very lucky to collect this,\" he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. \"As you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?\" \nHarry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness. \nIt took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts' house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But \nthen there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left. \nThe door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome \u2014 the teenage Voldemort. \nVoldemort's eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor. \n\"YOU!\" he bellowed. \"YOU!\" \nAnd he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft. \n\"Stop.\" \nRiddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it. \n\"You speak it?\" \n\"Yes, I speak it,\" said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort's complete lack of fear. His race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment. \n\"Where is Marvolo?\" he asked. \n\"Dead,\" said the other. \"Died years ago, didn't he?\" \nRiddle frowned. \n\"Who are you, then?\"\n\"I\u2019m Morfin, ain't I?\"\n\"Marvolo's son?\" \n\"'Course I am, then...\"?,,. \nMorfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo's black-stoned ring on his right hand. \n\"I thought you was that Muggle,\" whispered Morfin. \"You look mighty like that Muggle.\" \n\"What Muggle?\" said Riddle sharply. \n\"That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way,\" said Mor", "gt": "fin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. \"You look right like him.

Now he moved a little closer and said, \"Riddle came back?\" \n", "response": "fin, nodding toward the ruined mansion. \"Your father, sir... your father was no great shakes, was he?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Riddle calmly, \"I was never aware of him.\"\n\"No, no, I suppose not,\" said Morfin, dropping his voice even lower, \"no, I suppose not, sir, you've got a nice, respectable family, you've got...\n\"I've got what?\" said Riddle sharply.\n\"Respectability, sir, respectability....

However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort's past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin's release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.\" \n\"But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?\" Harry asked angrily \"He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!\" \"You are quite right \u2014 they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by \u2014\" \n\"Dobby,\" growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. \"So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?\" \n\"They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face. \"They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls.\" \n\"Well, that's rubbish,\" snapped Harry. \"Look what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!\" \n\"I agree,\" said Dumbledore. \"Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part....\" \nDumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad? \n\"This will not take long,\" said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. \"We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then...\" \nAnd Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once. \nIt was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple. \nHarry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn's office. Haifa dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo's gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father. \n\"Sir, is it true that Professor Mer", "gt": "rythought is retiring?\" he asked. \n\"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\u201d\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \n\"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn\u2019t, and your careful flatter", "response": "ula killed those Muggles?\" one of the boys asked.\n\"It is,\" said Slughorn. His eyes lingered upon Harry and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in them. \"And what do you think, Harry?\" he added, turning to face the boy.\n\"I think he's a twisted, mad old man,\" said Harry bluntly. He did not look at Dumbledore. \"I don'\u9996\u3000see how he can think that anyone but a Dark wizard could have done those things.\"\n\"Ah, but you see, Harry,\" said Sl", "rougeL": 0.1097560975609756, "rougeL_recall": 0.1125, "rouge1": 0.24390243902439024, "rouge1_recall": 0.25}, {"prompt": "at him. \n\"But surely, sir,\" he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, \"you don't need me \u2014 you could use Legilimency... or Veritaserum....\" \n\"Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,\" said Dumbledore. \"He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection. \n\"No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry.... How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck... and good night.\" \nA little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. \"Good night, sir.\" \nAs he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, \"I can't see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.\" \n\"I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas,\" replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry. \n\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\nThe next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron's presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.\nRon thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.\n'He loves you,' he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. 'Won't refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.'\nHermione, however, took a gloomier view.\n'He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn't get it out of him,' she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. 'Horcruxes... Horcruxes... I've never even heard of them...'\n'You haven't?'\nHarry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.\n'They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it's going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you'll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy...\"\n'Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon...'\n'Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it,' she said, flaring up at once. 'After all, when has Won-Won's judgement ever been faulty?'\n'Hermione, can't you \u2014'\n'No!' she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.\nPotions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.\n'What've you done?' Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione's haughty profile.\nBut before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.\n'Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott's Third Law... who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!'\nHermione recited at top speed: 'Golpalott's-Third-Law- states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to- more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale-", "gt": "components.'\n'Precisely!' beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott's Third Law as true...\"\nHarry was going to have to take Slughorn's word for it that Golpalott's Third Law was true, because he had not under-stood any of it.

He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word 'Bezoars'.\nHe opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!' Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.\n'Time's... UP!' called Slughorn genially. 'Well, let's see how you've done! Blaise... what have you got for me?'\nSlowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up com-pletely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.\nSlughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie's potion and passed on to Ron's with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron's cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.\n'And you, Harry,' he said. 'What have you got to show me?'\nHarry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.\nSlughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.\n'You've got a nerve, boy!' he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. 'Oh, you're like your mother... well, 1 can't fault you... a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!'\nHermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including a chunk of her own hair,\nbubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.\n'And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?' she asked through gritted teeth.\nThat's the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!' said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. 'Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it's undoubtedly from Lily he gets it... yes, Harry, yes, if you've got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick... although as they don't work on everything, and are pretty rare, it's still worth knowing how to mix antidotes...'\nThe only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled some-thing that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.\nTime to pack up!' said Slughorn. 'And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!'\nStill chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.\nHarry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.\n'Come on, now, Harry, you'll be late for your next lesson,' said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.\n'Sir,' said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, '1 wanted to ask you something.'\n'Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away...\"\n'Sir, 1 wondered what you know about... about Horc", "gt": "ruxes?'\nSlughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, 'What did you say?' 'I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir.

He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.\n'Dumbledore'", "response": "ruxes?'\n230\nSlughorn's face darkened.\n'Nothing, boy, nothing,' he said quickly.\n'You know, sir, it's possible you might not have read the latest edition of The Quibbler,' said Harry, grinning.\n'What's the latest edition of The Quibbler?'\n'Well, sir, it's a magazine, not a book, so it's updated, sir - '\n'I know what a magazine is, boy, I subscribe to The Quibbler,' said Slughorn,", "rougeL": 0.17142857142857143, "rougeL_recall": 0.16666666666666666, "rouge1": 0.22857142857142856, "rouge1_recall": 0.2222222222222222}, {"prompt": "you that \u2014 that memory,' said Slughorn.

'Of course... well, if you've seen that memory, Harry, you'll know that I don't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully '- about Horcruxes.' \nHe seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door. \n'Sir,' said Harry desperately, '1 just thought there might be a \n'Did you?' said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, weren't you? WRONG!' \nHe bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him. \nNeither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn't slipped him a bezoar, too. \n'It would've just looked stupid if we'd both done it!' said Harry irritably. 'Look, 1 had to try and soften him up so 1 could ask him about Voldemort, didn't I? Oh, will you get a grip!' he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of \nInfuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione's atti- \ntudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack. \nWhen Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac-tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him. \nMeanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar. \n'I haven't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!' she told him. 'Not a single one! I've been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile - listen - \"of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction\"... I mean, why mention it, then?' she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. 'Oh, shut up,' she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. \nThe snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-grey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth-years' first Apparition lesson, which was sched-uled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. \nWhen Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry.

He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouet-ting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him. \n'Never mind, never mind,' said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. 'Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions...' \nThe second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started. \nThe Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified. \n'Sph'nching, or the separation of random body parts,' said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, 'occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation... thus.'\nTwycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. 'Remember the three Ds,' he said, 'and try again... one -two - three -' \nBut an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, 'Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destin-ation. Determination. Deliberation.' \nWith that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall. \n'How did you do?' asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. '1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.' \n'1 expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,' said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking. \n'1 didn't feel anything,' said Harry, ignoring this inter-ruption. \"But 1 don't care about that now-' \n'What d'you mean, you don't care... don't you want to leam to Apparate?' said Ron incredulously. \n'I'm not fussed, really.

He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. \n'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. \n'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. \n'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy.

I don't think he's in his bed...' \nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. \n'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands.

The crowd laughed.\nHarry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.\n\"McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you're supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!\" bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.\n\"You're not setting a great example!\" McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.\n\"And Harry Potter's now having an argument with his Keeper,\" said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. \"I don't think that'll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it's a clever ruse....\"\nSwearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.\nGinny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd's attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called \"Loser's Lurgy.\"\n\"Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!\" barked Professor McGonagall into Luna's megaphone.\n\"Is it, already?\" said Luna vaguely. \"Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper's got hold of one of the Beater's bats.\"\nHarry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakes's bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.\n\"Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!\" roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.\nA blinding, sickening pain... a flash of light... distant screams... and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel...\nAnd the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.\n\"Nice of you to drop in,\" said Ron, grinning.\nHarry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago... as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harry's head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Cracked skull,\" said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. \"Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I'm keeping you in overnight. You shouldn't over exert yourself for a few hours.\"\n\"I don't want to stay here overnight,\" said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. \"I want to find McLaggen and kill him.\"\n\"I'm afraid that would come under the heading of 'overexertion,'\" said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. \"You will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.\"\nShe bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.\n\"D'you know how much we lost by?\" he asked Ron through clenched teeth.\n\"Well, yeah I do,\" said Ron apologetically. \"Final score was three hundred and twenty", "gt": "to sixty.\"\n\"Brilliant,\" said Harry savagely. \"Really brilliant!

Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.\n\"Kreacher?\"\nThere was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.\n\"What's going \u2014?\"\nHarry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey's office and muttered, \"Muffliato!\" so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at\nwhat was going on.\nTwo house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.\n\"I was watching that, Potty!\" he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. \"Look at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy \u2014\"\n\"Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won't, or Dobby will shut Kreacher's mouth for him!\" cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice.\n\"\u2014 kicky, scratchy!\" cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of' chalk at the elves to enrage them further. \"Tweaky, pokey!\"\n\"Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher's mistress say \u2014?\"\nExactly what Kreacher's mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher\u2019s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, \"Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies \u2014\"\nHarry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, \"Langlock!\" Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.\n\"Nice one,\" said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. \"That was another Prince hex, wasn't it?\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, twisting Kreacher's wizened arm into a half nelson. \"Right \u2014 I'm forbidding you to fight each other!

And why was she with you?\" \n  \nRon looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. \n  \n\"Thanks a lot, Hermione,\" said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. \"Listen, I\u2019ve got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore....\" \n  \nShe did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight. \n  \n\"Enter,\" called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside.

Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, \"Professor Dumbledore, I'm really sorry. I should have done more.... I should have realized you wouldn't have asked me to do it if it wasn't really important.\" \n  \n\"Thank you for saying that, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.\" \n  \n\"I'll do it, sir, I'll get it from him,\" he said earnestly. \n  \n\"Then we shall say no more about it just now,\" said Dumbledore more kindly, \"but continue with our story where we left off.

If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.\" Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. \"I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.\" \n  \nThe idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it. \n  \n\"I hope you are not tired of diving into other people's memories, for they are curious recollections, these two,\" he said. \"This first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts. \n  \n\"He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.\" \n  \n\"At Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry repeated, stunned. \n  \n\"At Borgin and Burkes,\" repeated Dumbledore calmly. \"I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey's memory.

In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. \n  \nThe house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips. \n  \n\"I brought you flowers,\" he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. \n  \n\"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!\" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \"You do spoil this old lady, Tom.... Sit down, sit down.... Where's Hokey? Ah...\" \n  \nThe house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow. \n  \n\"Help yourself, Tom,\" said Hepzibah, \"I know how you love my cakes.

They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times....\" \n  \nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered..|,! \n  \n\"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?\" she asked, bat-ring her lashes. \n  \n\"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\" said Voldemort. \"Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair \u2014\" \n  \n\"Now, now, not so fast, or I\u2019ll think you're only here for my trinkets!\" pouted Hepzibah. \n  \n\"I am ordered here because of them,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire \u2014\" \n  \n\"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!\" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \"I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone!

In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death \u2014\" \"Hokey confessed?\" \n  \n\"She remembered putting something in her mistress's cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, said Dumbledore. \"It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused \u2014\" \n  \n\"Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!\" \"Yes, that is my conclusion too,\" said Dumbledore. \"And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey \u2014\" \n  \n\"\u2014 because she was a house-elf,\" said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. \"Precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over \u2014 but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket. \n  \n\"By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah's family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time. \n  \n\"Now,\" said Dumbledore, \"if you don't mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him.

Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those...\" \n  \n\"Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore. \"I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.\" \"The locket maybe,\" said Harry, \"but why take the cup as well?\"", "response": "ibah'\u30dbKEY.\n\"And what did he do with them once he had them?\" said Dumbledore.\n\"I am coming to that.

The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking.... \n  \n\"Harry?

He heaved the gigantic spi-der into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again. \n  \n\"Of course, it's difficult for you, who knew him best,\" said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid's el-bow, but patted it all the same. \"Why don't I say a few words?\" \n  \nHe must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, \"Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won't forget!

Get on his other side, Harry.... That's it.... Up you come, Hagrid... Well done...\" \n  \nThey deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry's lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought. \n  \n\"I have had it all tested for poison,\" he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid's bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. \"Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\" \n  \nHarry saw, in his mind's eye, the expression on Hermione's face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves, and decided never to mention it to her. \n  \n\"One for Harry...\" said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle be-tween two mugs, \"... and one for me.

Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him. \n  \n\"I had him from an egg, yeh know,\" said Hagrid morosely. \"'Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \n  \n\"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\" \n  \nThe small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \n  \n\"Good gracious, is it that time already?

Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \n  \n\"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go....\" \n  \nHarry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \n  \n\"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\" \n  \n\"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \n  \n\"A bit... or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know \u2014 as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew \u2014 no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" \n  \nDumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \n  \n\"Where?\" asked Harry. \"How?\" \n  \n\"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \n  \n\"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \n  \n\"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-", "gt": "ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-nessed.

Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \n  \n\"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world \u2014 hidden \u2014 buried or invisible \u2014\" \n  \n\"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack \u2014 the piece that lives in his body.\" \n\"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \n\"You are forgetting... you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \n  \n\"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \n  \n\"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been \u2014 forgive me the lack of seemly modesty \u2014 for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \n  \n\"But how did you find it?\" \n\"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt\u2019s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \n\"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \n\"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles....\" \n  \n\"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \n  \n\"The diary wasn't that special.\" \n  \n\"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin.

It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \n\"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \n  \n\"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss... but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \n  \n\"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\" \n  \n\"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius\u2019s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence \u2014 but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius... what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" \n  \nHarry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?\" \n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \n  \n\"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, be-fore he could stop himself. \n  \n\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can \u2014\" \n\"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \n  \n\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how", "gt": "unusual you are, Harry.\" \n  \n\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means \u2014 love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \n  \n\"Yes \u2014 just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so.

We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, \nthat you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" \n  \nHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \n\"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \n  \n\"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal.... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy!

He will continue to hunt you... which makes it certain, really, that \u2014\" \n  \n\"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" \n  \nBut he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-dore knew \u2014 and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents \u2014 that there was all the difference in the world. \n\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\nExhausted but delighted with his night's work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morning's Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemort's Horcruxes and Dumbledore's promise to take Harry along, should he find another one. \n\"Wow,\" said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. \"Wow. You're actually going to go with Dumbledore... and try and destroy... wow.\" \n\"Ron, you're making it snow,\" said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Rons arm. \n\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. \"Sorry... looks like we've all got horrible dandruff now....\" \nHe brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her. \n\"We split up,\" he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth, \"Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn't see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.\" \n\"Ah,\" said Harry. \"Well \u2014 you don't mind it's over, do you?\", \"No,\" Ron admitted. \"It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn't have to finish it.\" \n\"Coward,\" said Hermione, though she looked amused. \"Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.\" \nHarry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him", "gt": "that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga.

You've got to let it stew....\" \n\"Typical,\" said Ron. \nHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned \"For Enemies,\" that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares. \nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. \nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well. \nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch. \nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand.... \nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own.

Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into flu-cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. \nMalfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own.

Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: \"MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!\" \nThe door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harry's curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy's face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. \nHarry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position. \n\"You need the hospital wing.

Come....\" \nHe supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, \"And you, Potter... You wait here for me.\" \nIt did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment. \nSnape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the", "gt": "door behind him. \n\"Go,\" he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her. \n\"I didn't mean it to happen,\" said Harry at once.

There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe. \nHarry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard's creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the Half-Blood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter.... Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone. \nHarry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron's copy of Advanced Potion-Making into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harry's schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited. \nOne by one, Snape extracted Harrys books and examined them., Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking. \n\"This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Harry, still breathing hard. \n\"You're quite sure of that, are you, Potter?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Harry, with a touch more defiance. \n\"This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly. \n\"Then why,\" asked Snape, \"does it have the name 'Roonil Wazlib' written inside the front cover?\" \nHarrys heart missed a beat. \"That's my nickname,\" he said.'\n\"Your nickname,\" repeated Snape. ; \"Yeah... that's what my friends call me,\" said Harry. \n\"I understand what a nickname is,\" said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry's; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind.... Close your mind.... But he had never learned how to do it properly.... \n\"Do you know what I think, Potter?\" said Snape, very quietly. \"I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. \"What do you think, Potter?\" \n\"I \u2014 I don't agree, sir,\" said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape's eyes. \n\"Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,\" said Snape. \"Ten o'clock Saturday morning, Potter.

There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan. \n\"Ah, Potter,\" said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them. \n\"Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,\" said Snape softly. \"They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes.

Aubreys head twice normal size. Double detention.\" Snape sneered. \"It must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains.\" \nHarry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him. \nIt was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started... Ginny playing Seeker against Cho... \nHarry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour... an hour... an hour and a half.... \nHarry's stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one. \n\"I think that will do,\" he said coldly. \"Mark the place you have reached.

Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations. \nThe so-called Half-Blood Prince.' \n'Oh, not again,' he groaned. 'Will you please drop it?' \nHe had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffer-ing accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince's book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout. \n'I'm not dropping it,' said Hermione firmly, 'until you've heard me out. Now, I've been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -' \n'He didn't make a hobby of it -' \n'He, he - who says it's a he?' \n'We've been through this,' said Harry crossly. 'Prince, Hermione, Prince!' \n'Right!' said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. 'Look at that! Look at the picture!' \nHarry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Under-neath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team. \n'So?' said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about inter-school competitions. \n'Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.' \nThey looked at each other and Harry realised what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing. \n'No way.' \n'What?' \n'You think she was the Half-Blood...? Oh, come on.' \n'Well, why not? Harry, there aren't any real princes in the wizarding world! It's either a nickname, a made-up title somebody's given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn't it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard \nwhose surname was \"Prince\", and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a \"half-blood Prince\"!' \n'Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione...' \n'But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!' \n'Listen, Hermione, I can tell it's not a girl. I can just tell.' \nThe truth is that you don't think a girl would have been clever enough,' said Hermione angrily. \n'How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?' said Harry, stung by this. 'It's the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn't got anything to do with it. Where did you get this, anyway?' \n\u2018The library,' said Hermione, predictably. There's a whole collection of old Prophets up there.

'But there was somebody already in there.' \n'Somebody in -? Who?' demanded Harry. 'Who was in there?' \n'? have no idea,' said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry's voice.

Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. \n\u2018The Inner Eye,' said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, 'was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.' \n'Right,' said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney's Inner Eye all too often before.

'He ought to know Malfoy's celebrating - I mean, that some-one threw you out of the Room.' \nTo his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty. \nThe Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,' she said coldly.

'Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time...' \n'Right,' said Harry again. 'Well... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room...' \n'You think so?' Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure. \n'I'm going to see him right now,' said Harry. 'I've got a meeting with him. We could go together.' \n'Oh, well, in that case,' said Professor Trelawney with a smile.

Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes.

And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself.

He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a fool-ish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger... \n'Harry,' said Dumbledore quietly.

'I want to know you lot are OK... don't look like that, Hermione, I'll see you later \nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall. \nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side. \n'I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,' said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, 'Very good. Shall we go?' \nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still pant-ing and sweating rather a lot. \n'But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?' Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape. \nThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,' said Dumbledore lightly. 'I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog's Head... or I appear to.

'You said Malfoy would be out tonight - '\n'I thought,' said Dumbledore, with a grim smile, 'that Malfoy would be most unlikely to go out, given that he is currently in detention with the dementors.'\nWhen Harry continued to look puzzled, Dumbledore said, 'Let me explain.

It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. \"Lumos,\" said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. \"You see?\" said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. \"You will not object to getting a little wet?\" \n\"No,\" said Harry. \n\"Then take off your Invisibility Cloak \u2014 there is no need for it now \u2014 and let us take the plunge,\" And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumble-dore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Harry's waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock. \nThen he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his sil-ver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air. \nDumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling. \n\"Yes, this is the place,\" said Dumbledore. \n\"How can you tell?\" Harry spoke in a whisper. \n\"It has known magic,\" said Dumbledore simply. Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of \nenchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. \"This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,\" said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \"We need to penetrate the inner place.... Now it is Lord Voldemort's obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made....\" \nDumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and for-ward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. \"Here,\" he said. \"We go on through here. The entrance is con-cealed.\" Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack. \n\"You've d-done it!\" said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around. \n\"Harry, I", "gt": "'m so sorry, I forgot,\" he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry's clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire. \n\"Thank you,\" said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had al-ready turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it.

Oh... okay...\" Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, \"Accio Horcrux!\" \nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. \n\"What was that?\" \n\"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\" \nHarry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding. \n\"Did you think that would happen, sir?\" \n\"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at-tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\" \n\"But we don't know what the thing was,\" said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water. \n\"What the things are, you mean,\" said Dumbledore. \"I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?\" \n\"Professor?\" \n\"Yes, Harry?\" \n\"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?\" \n\"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\" \n\"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\" \n\"Oh no... I think the Horcrux is in the middle.\" And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. \n\"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\" \n\"Yes, I think so.\" Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water mon-sters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites.... \n\"Aha,\" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. \"So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.\" \nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-thing invisible. \n\"Oho,\" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumble-dore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. \nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. \n\"How did you know that was there?\" Harry asked", "gt": "in astonish-ment. \n\"Magic always leaves traces,\" said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \"sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\" \n\"Is... is this boat safe?\" \n\"Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\" \n\"So the things in the water won't do anything", "response": "breathlessly.\n\"I have a shrewd idea,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"Now, give me the Horcrux.\" \n222\nHe raised his wand, but Harry, instead of pointing it at Dumbledore, pointed it at the chain.\n\"Accio!\" he shouted.\nThe chain flew suddenly out of Dumbledore's hand, stretched itself, and wrapped itself tightly around Dumbledore like a rope.

Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous. \n\"But one of them jumped,\" he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore's. \"When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\" \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\" Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry's bewildered expression. \n\"Oh... right...\" said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead... It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis.... He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them... and he hadn't seen Ginny at all... \n\"Nearly there,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. \"Careful not to touch the water,\" said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat. \nThe island was no larger than Dumbledore's office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liq-uid emitting that phosphorescent glow. \n\"What is it?\" asked Harry quietly. \n\"I am not sure,\" said Dumbledore. \"Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.\" Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his black-ened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. \n\"Sir, no, don't touch \u2014!\" \n\"I cannot touch,\" said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \"See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\" \nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air. \n\"Out of the way, please, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the-potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore with-drew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again. \n\"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\" \n\"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. \"But how to reach it? This potion cannot be pen-etrated by hand, Vanished, parted,", "gt": "scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.\" Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. \"I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.\" \n\"What?\" said Harry. \"No!\" \n\"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depth", "response": "as though it were made of air....

Incarcerous!\" A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \"Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!\" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul... \nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water.

The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to es-cape the fire in which they were enclosed.... \nDumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. \nHarry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface. \n\"Sir,\" panted Harry, \"sir, I forgot \u2014 about fire \u2014 they were coming at me and I panicked \u2014\" \n\"Quite understandable,\" murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. \nThey reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dum-bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall. \n\"I am weak...\" he said. \n\"Don't worry, sir,\" said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. \"Don't worry, I'll get us back....

As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind... \nHow long had they been away?

He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the bound-ary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed.

'But you were saying... yes, you have man-aged to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible... how did you do it?' \nBut Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was. \n'Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,' suggested Dumbledore. 'What if your back-up has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don't really need help... I have no wand at the moment... I cannot defend myself.' \nMalfoy merely stared at him. \n'I see,' said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither\nmoved nor spoke. 'You are afraid to act until they join\nyou.'? \n'I'm not afraid!' snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. 'It's you who should be scared!' \n'But why? I don't think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe... so tell me, while we wait for your friends... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.' \nMalfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter's heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, '1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one's used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.' \n'Aaaah.' \nDumbledore's sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment. \nThat was clever... there is a pair, I take it?' \n'The other's in Borgin and Burkes,' said Malfoy, 'and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was travelling between them, but he couldn't make anyone hear him... in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though he'd never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin didn't know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.' \n'Very good,' murmured Dumbledore. 'So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you... a clever plan, a very clever plan... and, as you say, right under my nose...' \n'Yeah,' said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore's praise. 'Yeah, it was!' \n'But there were times,' Dumbledore went on, 'weren't there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged meas-ures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink...' \n'Yeah, well, you still didn't realise who was behind that stuff, did you?' sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him. \n'As a matter of fact, I did,' said Dumbledore. 'I was sure it was you.' \n'Why didn't you stop me", "gt": ", then?' Malfoy demanded. \n'I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders -' \n'He hasn't been doing your orders, he promised my mother -' \n'Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but -' \n'He's a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn't working for you, you just think he is!' \n'We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape -", "response": "?' said Malfoy, his voice rising. 'Why did you let me get on with it, let me send the cursed necklace, let me poison Dumbledore? Why didn't you stop me?'\n'Because you needed to show me that I was the one you had been following all year,' said Dumbledore. 'You needed to prove to yourself that I was the one you had been trying to kill all year. And in the end, you could not bring yourself to do it. You could not bring yourself to make me die the way I died in your dreams.

'I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -' \n'Isn't that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore's Army used last year?' asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it. \n'Yeah, I got the idea from them,' said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. 'I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions...' \n\n\n'Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,' said Dumbledore. \nMalfoy gave a harsh laugh. \n'You care about me saying \"Mudblood\" when I'm about to kill you?' \n'Yes, I do,' said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. 'But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now. We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted...' \nMalfoy's mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter. \n'Now, about tonight,' Dumbledore went on, 'I am a little puzzled about how it happened... you knew that I had left the school? But of course,' he answered his own question, 'Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I'm sure...' \n'That's right,' said Malfoy. 'But she said you were just going for a drink, you'd be back...' \n'Well, I certainly did have a drink... and I came back... after a fashion,' mumbled Dumbledore. 'So you decided to spring a trap for me?' \n'We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who'd been killed,' said Malfoy. 'And it worked!' \n'Well... yes and no...' said Dumbledore. 'But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?' \n'Someone's dead,' said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. 'One of your people... I don't know who, it was dark... I stepped over the body... I was* supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way...' \n'Yes, they do that,' said Dumbledore. \nThere was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and Harry's heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest... someone was dead... Malfoy had stepped over the body... but who was it? \nThere is little time, one way or another,' said Dumbledore. 'So let us discuss your options, Draco.' \n'My options!' said Malfoy loudly. 'I'm standing here with a wand - I'm about to kill you -' \n'My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.' \n'I haven't got any options!' said Malfoy, and he was sud- denly as white as Dumbledore. 'I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!' \n'I appreciate the difficulty of your position,' said Dumbledore. 'Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you.' \nMalfoy winced at the sound of the name. \n'I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,' continued Dumbledore. 'But now at last we can speak plainly to each other... no harm has been", "gt": "done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived...

I've got no choice.' \n'Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide", "response": "done, and you are free to return to the fray.' \n'I'm not a fighter, I'm a thinker!' said Malfoy, who was still trembling. 'I don'\u9996*164*\nt like fighting, I don't like killing - '\n'You are not a thinker, Draco,' said Dumbledore, 'if you were, you would have realised that the only way you could have avoided this was to refuse to take the mission in the first place.

He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. 'We've got orders. Draco's got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.' \nMalfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore's face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall. \n'He's not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!' said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister's wheezing giggles. 'Look at him - what's happened to you, then, Dumby?' \n'Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,' said Dumbledore. 'Old age, in short... one day, perhaps, it will happen to you... if you are lucky...' \n'What's that mean, then, what's that mean?' yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. 'Always the same, weren't yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don't even know why the Dark Lord's bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!' \nBut at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, 'They've blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!'\nHarry's heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them - \n'Now, Draco, quickly!' said the brutal-faced man angrily. \nBut Malfoy's hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim. \nTil do it,' snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared. \n'I said no!' shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore's spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak - \n'Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us -' screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. \n'We've got a problem, Snape,' said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, 'the boy doesn't seem able -' \nBut somebody else had spoken Snape's name, quite softly. \n'Severus...' \nThe sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. \nSnape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. \nSnape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. \n'Severus... please...\" \nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. \n'Avada Kedavra!'\nA jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight. \n\nChapter 28: Flight of the Prince\nHarry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened....

The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know....\nHe skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -\nHe skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken....\nHe pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.\n\"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -\" began Ernie Macmillan.\n\"Out of the way!\" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.\nHarry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy....\nThe cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -\nAnother flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid... not Hagrid too...\nSomething caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him....\n\"Impedimenta!\" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.\nAnd now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the", "gt": "light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him.

Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.\n\"Hagrid,\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \"HAGRID?\"\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back.

Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \"Aguamenti\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\n\"S'not too bad,\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ'...\"\nHarry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name.

Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help-----\nThe crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.\nThe locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore's pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong-----\nHe turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.\nAutomatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him: \nTo the Dark Lord\nI now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret.

Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing.

Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry's vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.\n\"We're going to the hospital wing,\" said Ginny.\n\"I'm not hurt,\" said Harry.!\n\"It's McGonagalls orders,\" said Ginny. \"Everyone's up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone -\"\nFear stirred in Harry's chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.\n\"Ginny, who else is dead?\" \n\"Don't worry, none of us.\"\n\"But the Dark Mark - Malfoy said he stepped over a body -\"\n\"He stepped over Bill, but its all right, he's alive.\"\nThere was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\"Of course I'm sure... he's a - a bit of a mess, that's all.

She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. \"My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn't alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don't think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don't think he knew they were coming.\"\n\"It isn't your fault, Minerva,\" said Lupin firmly. \"We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way....\"\n\"So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters' side?\" asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape's duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.\n\"I don't know exactly how it happened,\" said Professor McGonagall distractedly. \"It's all so confusing.... Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case... Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us... and so we patrolled.

I still don't know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered....\"\n\"I do,\" said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. \"So they got in through the Room of Requirement.\"\nAlmost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.\n\"I messed up, Harry,\" said Ron bleakly. \"We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder", "response": "Dumbledore had even bewitched the school grounds so that Muggle-borns couldn't leave the school by themselves.\n\"It was about ten o'clock when we heard it. Someone had set off the Dark Mark.\"\n122\n\"Where?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply.\n\"Its hard to say,\" said Lupin. \"We searched the whole school, we even went into the forest -\"\n\"But they were already outside the school,\" said Harry, \"and they'd had time to set up the Marker before we got there.\"\n", "rougeL": 0.13333333333333333, "rougeL_recall": 0.13095238095238096, "rouge1": 0.27878787878787875, "rouge1_recall": 0.27380952380952384}, {"prompt": "'t realize, we just let Snape go!\"\n\"It's not your fault,\" said Lupin firmly. \"Hermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna.\"\n\"So then he came upstairs,\" said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mind's eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, \"and he found the place where you were all fighting....\"\n\"We were in trouble, we were losing,\" said Tonks in a low voice. \"Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback... It was all dark... curses flying everywhere... The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs... then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse.... Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -\"\n\"None of us could break through,\" said Ron, \"and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us....\"\n\"And then Snape was there,\" said Tonks, \"and then he wasn't -\"\n\"I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,\" said Ginny.\n\"I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn't there,\" said Lupin. \"I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville....\"\n\"He must have known a spell we didn't,\" whispered McGonagall. \"After all - he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who'd escaped up to the tower....\"\n\"He was,\" said Harry savagely, \"but to help them, not to stop them... and I'll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier - so what happened when he came back down?\"\n\"Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,\" said Lupin. \"We all ran forward - those of us who were still standing anyway - and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust - obviously, none of us attacked them -\"\n\"We just let them pass,\" said Tonks in a hollow voice. \"We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters - and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again - I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don't know what -\"\n\"He shouted, 'It's over,'\" said Harry. \"He'd done what he'd meant to do.\"\nThey all fell silent. Fawkes's lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry's mind.... Had they taken Dumbledore's body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.\nThe doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.\n\"Molly - Arthur -\" said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. \"I am so sorry -\"\n\"Bill,\" whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill's mangled face. \"Oh, Bill!\"\nLupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed.

I've done it, Professor,\" he choked. \"M-moved him. Professor Sprout's got the kids back in bed.

Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses - Slughorn can represent Slytherin - that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too.\"\nAs Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry. \"Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If you'll come with me....\"\nHarry stood up, murmured \"See you in a bit\" to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagall's office, but for Dumbledore's, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress,... Apparently she was now headmistress... so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.\nIn silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore's body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables, Gryffindor's sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Fawkes's perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.\nAfter glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the' desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.\n\"Harry,\" she said, \"I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.\"\n\"I can't tell you that, Professor,\" said Harry.

We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary -\"\n\"What about Dumbledore's funeral?\" said Harry, speaking at last.\n\"Well...\" said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. \"I - I know that it was Dumbledore's wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts -\"\n\"Then that's what'll happen, isn't it?\" said Harry fiercely.\n\"If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been -\"\n\"No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,\" growled Hagrid.\n\"Hogwarts should be Dumbledore's final resting place,\" said Professor Flitwick.\n\"Absolutely,\" said Professor Sprout.\n\"And in that case,\" said Harry, \"you shouldn't send the students home until the jfuneral's over.

He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he-had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.\n\"Is it true?\" whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. \"It is really true? Dumbledore - dead?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\nShe let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.\nAs Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys' dormitories.\nAs he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.\n\"They're talking about closing the school,\" said Harry.\n\"Lupin said they would,\" said Ron.\nThere was a pause.\n\"So?\" said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. \"Did you find one? Did you get it? A - a Horcrux?\"\nHarry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?\n\"You didn't get it?\" said Ron, looking crestfallen. \"It wasn't there?\"\n\"", "gt": "No,\" said Harry. \"Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.\"\n\"Already taken -?\"\nWordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait.... It did not matter tonight... nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledore's life....\n\"R.A.B.,\" whispered Ron, \"but who was that?\"\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and st", "response": "No,\" said Harry. He felt utterly miserable. \"I don't know what happened. I just walked past the lake, and there it was -- a great black mass, floating there -- and then, just like that, it was gone.\"\nHe sat and stared at the dark ceiling for a moment, then said, \"I'm going to bed.

'I haven't been sleeping thai well since... well... I could do with some sleep.' \nShe kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved al the other two and departed for the girls' dormitories.

There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and elim-inated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed.

Rupert \"Axebanger\" Brookstanton... but they don't seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can't find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him... no, actually, it's about... well, Snape.' \nShe looked nervous even saying the name again. \n'What about him?' asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair. \n'Well, it's just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,' she said tentatively. \n'D'you have to rub it in, Hermione? How tTyou think 1 feel about that now?' \n'No - no - Harry, I didn't mean that!' she said hastily, look-ing around to check that they were not being overheard.

Among Scrimgeour's entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom. \nOver at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were mutter-\ning together.

Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once. \n'It is nearly time,' she said. 'Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.' \nThey filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emerald-green robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reek-ing of mothbails. \nThey were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer's day. \nAn extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-Eye Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill sup-ported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry's Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the \nwizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air. \nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake.

He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water's edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said... \nAnd then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone... he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on... there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them \nstanding quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wiz-ards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remem-bered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated... \nAnd Harry saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent's arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before. \nThe little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved. \nThen several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore's body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore's body and the table on which he had rested. \nThere were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs' tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise the mer-people sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view. \nHarry looked ai Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron's face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Hermione's face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry's gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say 'Be careful', or 'Don't do it', but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died. \n'Ginny, listen...' he said very quietly, as the buzz of con-versation grew louder around them and people", "gt": "began to get to their feet.

He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\nHe'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on\nhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\" Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind.

The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\nthem and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....\nHow very wrong he was.\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\nAlbus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\nclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\nclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness.

Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow.

Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late.

He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a\n13\ngood one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\"\nHarry groaned.\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing...\"\nDudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten?

Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\n\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this.

In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.\nJust then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up\n17\nclose to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\"\n\"I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..

It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in\nthe mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.\n\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\nIt winked.\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\"I get that all the time.\n\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\n20\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\"\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you've never been to Brazil?\"\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE\nWHAT IT'S DOING!\"\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"\n21\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.

She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst\ninto tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet.\"\n\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've\nfinished.\"\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,\n24\non the table.\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \"Make Harry get it.\"\n\"Get the mail, Harry.\"\n\"Make Dudley get it.\"\n\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a\nbill, and -- a letter for Harry.\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\nMr. H. Potter\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n4 Privet Drive\nLittle Whinging\nSurrey\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.\n25\n\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.

It only took Harry one trip\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\nbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was\n28\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'\"\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first\nletter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure\nthey didn't fail. He had a plan.\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --\nHarry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\nsure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.

The woman stared.\n\"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\nWouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.\n\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. \"\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day.\n32\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.\n\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\"\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\n\"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\nUncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately\nagreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\n33\nroom and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa.

Soon the hut was full of the sound and\nsmell of sizzling sausage.

A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned\ninto warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\n\"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard.\"\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\"\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his\n44\nrevenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him?\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.\"\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.\n\"Haven't I told you he's not going?\" he hissed. \"He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs\nall sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --\"\n\"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--\"\n\"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\"\nyelled Uncle Vernon.\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled\nit over his head, \"NEVER,\" he thundered, \"- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE- IN- FRONT- OF- ME!\"\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a\nsharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in\nhis trousers.\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n45\n\"Shouldn'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn't work", "gt": "\nanyway.

Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore.

Come on, then.\"\n48\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\n\"Flew?\"\n\"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.\"\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \"If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\"\n\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked.\n\"Spells -- enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never\nhad so many questions in his life.\n\"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\"'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '\n49\ncourse, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.\"\n\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\"\n\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.\"\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town\nto the station.

The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\n\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --?\"\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an honor.\"\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\nHarry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\" \"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\"\n53\n\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter.\"\n\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.\"\n\"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\n\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\n\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"\n\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\"\n\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\nBut the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"\nDoris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\"Told yeh, didn't I?

The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely.\n\"That seems to be in order.\"\n\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\"\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\n\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked.\n\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.\"\n57\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,\nbut it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.\nHarry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\nI never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\n\"Stalagmite's got an'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\"\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns\nof silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\nAll Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to\n58\na Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,\nthat should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe\nfor yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly", "gt": "?\"\n\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed.

They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.

There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but --\"\n\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.\n\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.\nHalf terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry\nin it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n68\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the\nnight, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\nto the wall, counting down to September the first.\nOn the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\"Er -- Uncle Vernon?\"\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.\"\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\"\nGrunt.

He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\" he read.\n69\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\"Platform what?\"\n\"Nine and three-quarters.\"\n\"Don't talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\"\n\"It's on my ticket.\"\n\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.\"\n\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"\nHarry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry, and they had set off.\nThey reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\"Well, there", "gt": "you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten.

People jostled him on their way to\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer\nand nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control\n-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --\nIt didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet\nsteam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\"\n\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started\nto shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it\nup the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through\n73\nthe barrier.\n\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\n\"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\"\nWith the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\"What's that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar.\n\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you\n\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you?\" he added to Harry.\n\"What?\" said Harry.\n\"Harry Potter, \"chorused the twins.\n\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\"\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.\n\"Fred? George? Are you there?\"\n\"Coming, Mom.\"\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\"Ron, you've got something on your nose.\"\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free.\n74\n\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins.\n\"Shut up,\" said Ron.\n\"Where's Percy?\" said their mother. \"He's coming now.\"\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight.

He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"\n\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"\n\"Horrible -well, not all of them.

He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\nHarry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"\nRon gasped. \"What?\" said Harry.\n\"You said You-Know-Who's name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people --\"\n\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn't.

Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.

The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in.

The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\" She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\"Er -- all right.\"\nHe cleared his throat.\n\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"\n83\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened.

There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....\nSo where shall I put you?\"\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.

Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost.\"\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\nsitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained\nwith silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.\n\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n99\n\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married.

My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might\nnot be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\nOn Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across\nthe scar on Harry's forehead.\n\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy.\n100\n\"N-nothing.\"\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.\n\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\n\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you?

They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects.

They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\" Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\"\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was\nhis destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it\ngot heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened\npainfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nTHE POTIONS MASTER There, look.\"\n\"Where?\"\n104\n\"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\" \"Wearing the glasses?\"\n\"Did you see his face?\"\n\"Did you see his scar?\"\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look\nat him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.\nHarry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors\nthat weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit\neach other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\nThe ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.

Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\n\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.\"\n\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge\npile of homework the day before.\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,\n107\ncircling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\nHedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy\nscrawl:\nDear Harry,\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\nHagrid\nHarry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\n\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\n108\nhands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving\nhere, many of you will hardly believe this is magic.

He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back.\"\nHagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner\n111\nstood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git.\"\n\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"\nYet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\"How's yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\"\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n112\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone", "gt": "had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!

They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a\n115\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say 'Up!\"'\n\"UPF everyone shouted.\nHarry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three\n-- two --\"\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it's all right,\n116\nup you get.\".\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!

The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\nand quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\nknew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\nHarry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.\n128\nThey fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.

Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\n\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on.\n\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"\n\"No, not the floor.

It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\nAs seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end\n132\nof the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\nchildren blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\"Hey, Potter, come down!'\nOliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\n\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.\nThree of them are called Chasers.\"\n\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"\n\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?\"\n\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.\n\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"\n133\n\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle.

Even better, Professor Flitwick announced\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\n\"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as\nusual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick.

On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.

Bit keen, aren't yeh?\"\n\"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\"\n\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.\"\n\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione.\n\"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere.\"\n\"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.\n\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\nwas trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\nbook. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\nsearch while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted\nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in\n157\nthere. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\"What are you looking for, boy?\"\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry.\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!\"\nWishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left\nthe library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were\nup to.\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\n\"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"\n\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It'd be safe to ask them.\"\n\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione.\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.

Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\n\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the matter?\"\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else\nyet.\n\"Merry Christmas!\"\n\"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\"\n\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.\"\n\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n161\n\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name.

A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,\nfinally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's\n162\namazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.

He had been\nso busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\n\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section.\"\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.\"\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor\nand if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying\nnot to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic\n165\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,\ntoo? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.

Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want... whatever we want...\"\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.

He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.\"\n\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\" Neville shook his head.\n\"I don't want more trouble,\" he mumbled.\n\"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\"\n\"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out.\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,\nthe very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\"You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\"\nNeville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\n\"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?\"\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n174\n\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\n\"I've found him!\" he whispered. \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!\"\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\n\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\"I knew it! I knew it!\"\n\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\n\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!\"\nThis didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.\n\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\n\"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a\n175\nlegendary substance with astonishing powers.

It was Malfoy.\n\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.\"\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\nRon didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It's people they feel sorry for.

Where?\"\n178\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy.\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\n\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\"Ron!

In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.

They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones.

Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get\nthrough all their extra work.\n\"I'll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the\nfirst really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\nHarry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you\ndoing in the library?\"\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\n\"Jus' lookin',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at\nonce. \"An' what're you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --\"\n\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?\"\n\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"\n\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it\nin here, students", "gt": "aren' s'pposed ter know.

In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's er...\"\n\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must've cost you a fortune.\"\n\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las' night.

They're rare, them.\"\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't. \"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.\nBut Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n186\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching.\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it.\n\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\"\n\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --\"\n\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.

He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green.

On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke\n190\ninto a sweat.\n\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"\nHarry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it.

Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do.

Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.\"\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.\n198\n\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. \"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there\n-- werewolves, I heard.\"\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.\n\"That's your problem, isn't it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with\nglee. \"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?\"\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n\"Abou' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin' fer half an hour already.

At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\"\n202\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.\n\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\" \"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\n\"Well enough.

They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n206\n\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"\n\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said\nFirenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?\"\n\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long\nenough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.

But I don't understand who --\"\n\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's\nheart.

One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree.

And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\nHarry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\"\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\n\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry.

They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\"Now what?\" said Ron.\n\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\n\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\"\n\"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door.\n\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\"\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\n224\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there", "gt": "-- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"\nRon dived, Hermione rocket", "response": "-- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it.

I've got to be taken.\" \"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\"\n\"But --\"\n\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\n\"Ron --\"\n\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\"\nThere was no alternative.\n\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now,\n227\ndon't hang around once you've won.\"\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -\nHermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.\n\"What if he's --?\"\n\"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon's next?\"\n\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.\"\nThey had reached another door. \"All right?\" Harry whispered. \"Go on.\"\nHarry pushed it open.\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can't breathe.\"\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n228\n\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At\nthe same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\nYou will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end,\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n229\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\n\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.\"\n\"But so will we, won't", "gt": "we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\"\n\"But how do we know which to drink?\" \"Give me a minute.\"\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\n\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bott", "response": "we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper.

He was trying to make sure I didn't do it\nagain. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\"\n232\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\"\n\"You let the troll in?\"\n\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.\n\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the\ntime he gets back....\"\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\n\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.\n\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n\"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?\" Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He\n233\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\n\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\"\n\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you....\"\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"\n\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.\n\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of\nridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too\nweak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"\nQuirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\nQuirrell cursed under his breath", "gt": ".\n\"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror?

Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\"\n\"NEVER!\"\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At\nonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as\nthough it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his\nmight, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.\n\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,\nyet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\n237\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --\n\"AAAARGH!\"\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible\npain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as\ntight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the\npain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only\nhear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\"\nHe felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down...\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.\nHe blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\n\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick --\"\n\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"\n\"Then who does? Sir, I --\"\n\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next\n238\nto him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.

It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?\"\n\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"\n\"And there's something else...\" \"Fire away.\"\n\"Quirrell said Snape --\"\n\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father.

It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be\nable to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans!

Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. \"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.\n\"Absolutely not.\"\n242\n\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"\n\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\"\n\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...\"\n\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\"Harry!\"\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --\"\n\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors.

He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\n245\nstanding up to look at him.\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.

Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"\nThe room went very still.

Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin.

Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing - 'for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.\n    He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potters appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below.\n    On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle.\n    Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle, suddenly spoke.\n    'Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in.

Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.\n    Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.\n    'Lovely evening!' shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. 'Did you hear that car backfire just now?

'Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!'\n    Harry hesitated for a moment.

Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK...Be careful and don't do anything rash...\n    Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised. He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen Hippogriff.\n    Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys' flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected... nothing to worry about... old news...\n    The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn't been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And. his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These curious thoughts whirled around in Harry's head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings. He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.\n    Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin, Dudley Dursley wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.\n    Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year's hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-school Boxing Champion of the Southeast. 'The noble sport', as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley's first punchball.

I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago - '\n    'He was asking for it,' snarled Dudley.\n    'Oh yeah?'\n    'He cheeked me.'\n    'Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true.'\n    A muscle was twitching in Dudley's jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.\n    They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.\n    Think you're a big man carrying that thing, don't you?' Dudley said after a few seconds.\n    'What thing?'\n    That - that thing you are hiding.'\n    Harry grinned again.\n    'Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s'pose, if you were, you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time.'\n    Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.\n    'You're not allowed,' Dudley said at once. 'I know you're not. You'd get expelled from that freak school you go to.'\n    'How d'you know they haven't changed the rules, Big D?'\n    They haven't,' said Dudley, though he didn't sound completely convinced.\n    Harry laughed softly.\n    'You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?' Dudley snarled.\n    'Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?'\n    'He was sixteen, for your information,' snarled Dudley, 'and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I'd finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out -\n    'Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's wand?'\n    'Not this brave at night, are you?' sneered Dudley.\n    'This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this.'\n    'I mean when you're in bed!' Dudley snarled.\n    He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.\n    From the little he could see of Dudley's large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look.\n    'What d'you mean, I'm not brave when I'm in bed?' said Harry, Completely nonplussed. 'What am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?'\n    'I heard you last night,' said Dudley breathlessly. Talking in your sleep. Moaning.'\n    'What d'you mean?' Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.\n    Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice.\n   '\"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!\" Who's Cedric - your boyfriend?'\n    'I - you're lying,' said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry.

Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. 'Where's - wand - come on - lumos!'\n    He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him n his search - and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand - the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet and turned around.\n    His stomach turned over.\n    A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came.\n    Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his wand.\n    'Expecto patronum!'\n    A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the spell hadn't worked properly; tripping over his own feet, Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain - concentrate -\n    A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementor's robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry's ears.\n    'Expecto patronum!'\n    His voice sounded dim and distant. Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand - he couldn't do it any more, he couldn't work the spell.\n    There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter... he could smell the Dementor's putrid, death-cold breath filling his own lungs, drowning him - think... something happy...\n    But there was no happiness in him... the Dementor's icy fingers were closing on his throat - the high-patched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head: 'Bow to death, Harry... it might even be painless...

Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. 'DUDLEY? DUDLEY!'\n    He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over his face. A second Dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head towards Dudley's face as though about to kiss him.\n    'GET IT!' Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him. The Dementor's eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley's when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.\n    Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway.

He had short, bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound. He was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognised at once as an Invisibility Cloak.\n   ''S'up, Figgy?' he said, staring from Mrs Figg to Harry and Dudley.

If their least favourite thing in the world was magic - closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban - people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.\n    'What sort of things did you hear, Popkin?' breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.\n    But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life. What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear?\n    'How come you fell over, son?' said Uncle Vernon, in an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he might adopt at the Bedside of a very ill person.\n    'T-tripped,' said Dudley shakily.

Really cold.'\n    'OK,' said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley's forehead to feel his temperature.

Two of them.'\n    'And what the ruddy hell are Dementors?'\n    'They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,' said Aunt Petunia.\n    Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry's brain reeled. Mrs Figg was one thing - but Aunt Petunia?\n    'How d'you know that?' he asked her, astonished.\n    Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth.\n    'I heard - that awful boy - telling her about them - years ago,' she said jerkily.\n    'If you mean my mum and dad, why don't you use their names?' said Harry loudly but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered.\n    Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry's mother had been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister.

'I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!'\n    But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl's leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything - the Dementors, Mrs Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out - that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernons ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message.\n    Arthur has just told us what's happened. Don't leave the house again, whatever you do.\n    Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing else.\n    And now his temper was rising again. Wasn't anybody going to say 'well done' for fighting off two Dementors single-handed? Both Mr Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he'd misbehaved, and were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done.\n    '... a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house.

He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.\n    'I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors,' he said, forcing himself to remain calm. 'It's the only thing that works against them.'\n    'But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging?' said Uncle Vernon in an outraged tone.\n    'Couldn't tell you,' said Harry wearily. 'No idea.'\n    His head was pounding in the glare of the strip-lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him.\n    'It's you,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 'It's got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You've got to be the only - the only -'Evidently, he couldn't bring himself to say the word 'wizard'. The only you-know-what for miles.'\n    'I don't know why they were here.'\n    But at Uncle Vernon's words, Harry's exhausted brain had ground back into action. Why had the Dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the Dementors?

Don't leave the house again, whatever you do.

Harry raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight back up the chimney.\n    Harry darted forwards to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat him to it.\n    'You can open it if you like,' said Harry, 'but I'll hear what it says anyway. That's a Howler.'\n    'Let go of it, Petunia!' roared Uncle Vernon. 'Don't touch it, it could be dangerous!'\n    'It's addressed to me,' said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice.

Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.\n    An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.\n    'Remember my last, Petunia.'\n    Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence.\n    'What is this?' Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. 'What - I don't - 'Petunia?'\n    Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiralled horribly. Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to burst.\n    'Petunia, dear?' said Uncle Vernon timidly. 'P-Petunia?'\n    She raised her head. She was still trembling.

Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat-Flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn't see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry he'd perform more illegal magic.\n    So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess; and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.\n    What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. Might he be able to move into Sirius's house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him? Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.\n    On the fourth night after Hedwig's departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.\n    'We're going out,' he said.\n    'Sorry?'\n    'We - that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I - are going out.'\n    'Fine,' said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.\n    'You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.'\n    'OK.'\n    'You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.'\n    'Right.'\n    'You are not to steal food from the fridge.'\n    'OK.'\n    'I am going to lock your door.'\n    'You do that.'\n    Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.\n    Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.\n    The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry ay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.\n    Then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.\n    He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn't be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn't heard their car.\n    There was silence for a few seconds, then voices.\n    Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed on to his feet - but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly", "gt": "not troubling to do so.\n    He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood lacing his bedroom door, listening with all his might.

Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. 'We need more height... give it another quarter of a mile!'\n    Harry's eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards: he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon's car... the Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent Lawn Competition... and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air.

He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver.\n    They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye's instructions. Harry's eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least.\n    'Turning southwest!' yelled Moody 'We want to avoid the motorway!'\n    Harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of travelling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight.., now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right... then she, too, swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore...\n    'We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we're not being followed!' Moody shouted.\n    'ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?' Tonks screamed from the front. 'We're all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off-course we're not going to get there until next week!

They were heading for the Largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys and television aerials.

He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board. Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.\n    There were hurried footsteps and Ron's mother, Mrs Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them, though Harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her.\n    'Oh, Harry, it's lovely to see you!' she whispered, pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm's length and examining him critically.

A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snout-like nose.\n    Harry's bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of wizards?\n    'Mrs Weasley, why -?'\n    'Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I've really got to dash,' Mrs Weasley whispered distractedly.

Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking at him mournfully.\n    'Seen old Figgy since?' he asked.\n    'No,' said Harry, 'I haven't seen anyone.'\n    'See, I wouldn't 'ave left,' said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, 'but I 'ad a business opportunity - '\n    Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry's legs, purring, then jumped on to Sirius's lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absent-mindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry.\n    'Had a good summer so far?'\n    'No, it's been lousy,' said Harry.\n    For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius's free.\n    'Don't know what you're complaining about, myself.'\n    'What?' said Harry incredulously.\n    'Personally, I'd have welcomed a Dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you've had it bad, at least you've been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights... I've been stuck inside for a month.'\n    'How come?' asked Harry, frowning.\n    'Because the Ministry of Magic's still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. There's not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix... or so Dumbledore feels.'\n    There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius, too, was not very happy with the Headmaster. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather.\n    'At least you've known what's been going on,' he said bracingly.\n    'Oh yeah,' said Sirius sarcastically. 'Listening to Snape's reports, having to take all his snide hints that he's out there risking his life while I'm sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time... asking me how the cleaning's going - '\n    'What cleaning?' asked Harry.\n    Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,' said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. 'No one's lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he's gone round the twist - hasn't cleaned anything in ages.'\n    'Sirius,' said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation, but had been closely examining an empty goblet. This solid silver, mate?'\n    'Yes,' said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. 'Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.'\n    'That'd come orf, though,' muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff.\n    'Fred - George - NO, JUST CARRY THEM!' Mrs Weasley shrieked.\n    Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked round and, within a split second, they had dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of Butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point", "gt": "down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.\n    'FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!' screamed Mrs Weasley.

'But, you know, Will nicked 'em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn't really doing nothing wrong.'\n    'I don't know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,' said Mrs Weasley coldly.\n    Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer; George was hiccoughing. For some reason, Mrs Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.\n    'Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus,' said Sirius in an undertone.\n    'How come he's in the Order?' Harry said, very quietly.\n    'He's useful,' Sirius muttered. 'Knows all the crooks - well, he would, seeing as he's one himself. But he's also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don't. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn't forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.'\n    Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and I he waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley's). As he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation: Mr Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed; Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal; and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling Butterbeer corks for him to chase.\n    'Nearly time for bed, I think,' said Mrs Weasley with a yawn.\n    'Not just yet, Molly,' said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. 'You know, I'm surprised at you. I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.'\n    The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of Dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort's name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.\n    'I did!' said Harry indignantly.

I can see I' going to be overruled. I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has Harry's best interests at heart -'\n    'He's not your son,' said Sirius quietly.\n    'He's as good as,' said Mrs Weasley fiercely. 'Who else has he got?'\n    'He's got me!'\n    'Yes,' said Mrs Weasley, her lip curling, 'the thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?'\n    Sirius started to rise from his chair.\n    'Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,' said Lupin sharply. 'Sirius, sit down.'\n    Mrs Weasleys lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his face white.\n    'I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,' Lupin continued, 'he's old enough to decide for himself.'\n    'I want to know what's been going on,' Harry said at once.\n    He did not look at Mrs Weasley. He had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling. Sirius was right, he was not a child.\n    'Very well,' said Mrs Weasley, her voice cracking. 'Ginny - Ron - Hermione - Fred - George - I want, you out of this kitchen, now.'\n    There was instant uproar.\n    'We're of age!' Fred and George bellowed together.\n    'If Harry's allowed, why can't I?' shouted Ron.\n    'Mum, I want to hear!' wailed Ginny\n    'NO!' shouted Mrs Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. 'I absolutely forbid - '\n    'Molly you can't stop Fred and George,' said Mr Weasley wearily. They are of age.'\n    They're still at school.'\n    'But they're legally adults now,' said Mr Weasley, in the same tired voice.\n    Mrs Weasley was now scarlet in the face.\n    'I - oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron - '\n    'Harry'll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!' said Ron hotly. 'Won't - won't you?' he added uncertainly, meeting Harry's eyes.\n    For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn't tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other.\n    'Course I will,' Harry said.\n    Ron and Hermione beamed.\n    'Fine!' shouted Mrs Weasley. 'Fine! Ginny - BED!'\n    Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs Blacks ear-splitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait: to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.\n    'OK, Harry... what do you want to know?'\n    Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month.\n    'Where's Voldemort", "gt": "?' he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name.

'But it seems he's become fond of power, and much more confident. He loves being Minister for Magic and he's m; n-aged to convince himself that he's the clever one and Dumbledore's simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.'\n    'How can he think that?' said Harry angrily. 'How can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up - that I'd make it all up?'\n    'Because accepting that Voldermort's back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn't had to cope with for nearly fourteen yea's,' said Sirius bitterly. 'Fudge just can't bring himself to face it. It's so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore's lying to destabilise him.'\n    'You see the problem,' said Lupin. 'While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort it's hard to convince people he's back, especially as they really don't want to believe it in the first place. What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they're calling Dumbledore's rumour-mongering, so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware anything's happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they're using the Imperius Curse.'\n    'But you're telling people, aren't you?' said Harry, looking around at Mr Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin and Tonks. 'You're letting people know he's back?'\n    They all smiled humourlessly.\n    'Well, as everyone thinks I'm a mad mass-murderer and the Ministry's put a ten thousand Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?' said Sirius restlessly.\n    'And I'm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,' said Lupin. 'It's an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.'\n    'Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,' said Sirius, 'and it's very important\n    for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.'\n    'We've managed to convince a couple of people, though,' said Mr Weasley. Tonks here, for one - she's too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage - Kingsley Shacklebolt's been a real asset, too; he's in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he's been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.'\n    'But if none of you are putting the news out that Voldemort's back -'Harry began.\n    'Who said none of us are putting the news out?' said Sirius. 'Why d'you think Dumbledore's in such trouble?'\n    'What d'you mean?' Harry asked.\n    They're trying to discredit him,' said Lupin. 'Didn't you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true; he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort's return. They've demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot - that's the Wizard High Court - and they're talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.'\n    'But Dumbledore says he doesn't care what they do as long as they don't take him off the Chocolate Frog Cards,' said Bill, grinning.\n    'It's no laughing matter,' said Mr Weasley sharply.

They weren't alone, either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colours, who thought he had the right idea about things... they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though.

'No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person.

I've asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you, to your hearing - as Snuffles, obviously - so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d'you think?'\n    Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius's words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.\n    'Don't worry,' Sirius said. Harry looked up and realised that Sirius had been watching him. 'I'm sure they'll clear you, there's definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.'\n    But if they do expel me,' said Harry quietly, 'can I come back here and live with you?'\n    Sirius smiled sadly.\n    'We'll see.'\n    'I'd feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn't have to go back to the Dursleys',' Harry pressed him.\n    They must be bad if you prefer this place,' said Sirius gloomily.\n    'Hurry up, you two, or there won't be any food left,' Mrs Weasley called.\n    Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, then he and Harry went to join the others.\n    Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the glass-fronted cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.\n    'Its OK,' he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal,'must be Wartcap powder in there.'\n    He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already Doxy-filled pocket.\n    They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry's arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius's grandfather for'services to the Ministry'.\n    'It means he gave them a load of gold,' said Sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.\n    Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large go den ring bearing the Black crest from his grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.\n    'It was my father's,' said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack.

For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered.\n    Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him. Trying net to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and down into the kitchen.\n    He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered.\n    'Breakfast,' she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.\n    'M - m - morning, Harry,' yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. 'Sleep all right?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'I've b - b - been up all night,' she said, with another shuddering yawn. 'Come and sit down...'\n    She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it ir the process.\n    'What do you want, Harry?' Mrs Weasley called. 'Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?'\n    'Just - just toast, thanks,' said Harry.\n    Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, 'What were you saying about Scrimgeour?'\n    'Oh... yeah... well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions...'\n    Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation.

Up the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic.\n    'Where are we?' said Mr Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, 'Ah yes... this way, Harry,' and led him down a side road.\n    'Sorry,' he said, 'but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact, I've never even used the visitors' entrance before.'\n    The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing skip.

'After you, Harry.'\n    He opened the telephone-box door.\n    Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.\n    'Mr Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,' Harry said.\n    'No, no, I'm sure its fine,' said Mr Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. 'Let's see... six...' he dialled the number, 'two... four... and another four... and another two...'\n    As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them.\n    'Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.'\n    'Er...' said Mr Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver. He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, 'Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing...'\n    'Thank you,' said the cool female voice. 'Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.'\n    There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.\n    'Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium '\n    The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth.

'We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing - well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those - pumbles, I think they're called - you know, the ones who mend pipes and things.'\n    'Plumbers?'\n    'Exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed, f only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.'\n    'Will it be Aurors who catch them?'\n    'Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - ah, Harry, this is Perkins.'\n    A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting.\n    'Oh, Arthur!' he said desperately, without looking at Harry. Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not. I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it - an urgent message came ten minutes ago - '\n    'I know about the regurgitating toilet,' said Mr Weasley.\n    'No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing - they've changed the time and venue - it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten - '\n    'Down in old - but they told me - Merlin's beard!'\n    Mr Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp and leapt from his chair.\n    'Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!'\n    Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr Weasley left the office at a run, Harry close on his heels.\n    'Why have they changed the time?' Harry said breathlessly, as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he'd felt all his insides back at Perkins's desk.\n    'I've no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you'd missed it, it would have been catastrophic!'\n    Mr Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the 'down' button.\n    'Come ON!'\n    The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button.\n    'Those courtrooms haven't been used in years,' said Mr Weasley angrily.

Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed, too, with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudges left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudges right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.\n    'Very well,' said Fudge. 'The accused being present - finally - let us begin. Are you ready?' he called down the row.\n    'Yes, sir,' said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand.\n    'Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,' said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, 'into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry-James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.\n    'Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister.

His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose.\n    The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome.\n    A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore's eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.\n    'Ah,' said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. 'Dumbledore. Yes. You - er - got our - er - message that the time and - er - place of the hearing had been changed, then?'\n    'I must have missed it,' said Dumbledore cheerfully. 'However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.'\n    'Yes - well - I suppose we'll need another chair - I - Weasley, could you -?'\n    'Not to worry, not to worry,' said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, out the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.\n    'Yes,' said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. 'Well, then. So. The charges.

She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers.\n    Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.\n    'Full name?' said Fudge loudly, when Mrs Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat.\n    'Arabella Doreen Figg,' said Mrs Figg in her quavery voice.\n    'And who exactly are you?' said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice\n    'I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs Figg.\n    'We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once 'That situation has always been closely monitored, given... given past events.'\n    'I'm a Squib,' said Mrs Figg.

She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.\n    The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,' said Fudge.\n    The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.\n    'I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,' she said, with a simper that felt her big, round eyes as cold as ever. 'So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!'\n    She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused.\n    'If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,' said Dumbledore politely. 'Of course, these particular Dementors may have been outside Ministry control - '\n    'There are no Dementors outside Ministry control! snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red.\n    Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.\n    'Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation.'\n    'It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!' snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.\n    'Of course it isn't,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.'\n    He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly.\n    'I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these Dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!' said Fudge. 'We are here to examine Harry Potter's offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!'\n    'Of course we are,' said Dumbledore, 'but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant.

He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention, except the toadlike witch on Fudge's right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge's eye, or Madam Bones's, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and, when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.\n    He took the last lew steps at a run, wrenched open the door and almost collided with Mr Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale and apprehensive.\n    'Dumbledore didn't say - '\n    'Cleared,' Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, 'of all charges!'\n    Beaming, Mr Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.\n    'Harry, that's wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn't have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can't pretend I wasn't - '\n    But Mr Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had ust opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out.\n    'Merlin's beard!' exclaimed Mr Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass. 'You were tried by the lull court?'\n    'I think so,' said Harry quietly.\n    One or two of the wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, 'Morning, Arthur,' to Mr Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, hut again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr Weasley's mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son.\n    'I'm going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,' he said, beckoning Harry forwards as Percy's heels disappeared up the steps to Level Nine. 'I'll drop you off on the way to that toilet", "gt": "in Bethnal Green. Come on...'\n    'So, what will you have to do about the toilet?' Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: he was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.\n    'Oh, it's a simple enough anti-jinx,' said Mr Weasley as they mounted the stairs, 'but it's not so much having to repair the damage, it's more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry.

He waved them away irritably.\n    'Mr Weasley,' said Harry slowly, 'if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he's seeing them alone, how do we know they haven't put the Imperius Curse on him?'\n    'Don't think it hasn't occurred to us, Harry,' said Mr Weasley quietly. 'But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment - which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. Best not talk about it any more just now, Harry.'\n    The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium. Eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.\n    'Wait...' he told Mr Weasley, and, pulling his moneybag from his pocket, he turned back to the fountain.\n    He looked up into the handsome wizard's face, but close-to Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf's attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his moneybag upside-down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool.\n*\n'I knew it!' yelled Ron, punching the air. 'You always get away with stuff!'\n    'They were bound to clear you,' said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes, 'there was no case against you, none at all.'\n    'Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering you all knew I'd get off,' said Harry, smiling.\n    Mrs Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went: 'He got off, he got off, he got off...'\n    That's enough! Settle down!' shouted Mr Weasley, though he too was smiling. 'Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry - '\n    'What?' said Sirius sharply.\n    'He got off, he got off, he got off...'\n    'Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on Level Nine, then they went up to Fudge's office together. Dumbledore ought to know.'\n    'Absolutely,' said Sirius. 'We'll tell him, don't worry.'\n    'Well, I'd better get going, there's a vomiting toilet waiting for me in Bethnal Green. Molly, I'll be late, I'm covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner - '\n    'He got off, he got off, he got off...'\n    That's enough - Fred - George - Ginny!' said Mrs Weasley, as Mr Weasley left the kitchen. 'Harry, dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast.'\n    Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him, looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at Grimmauld Place, and Harry's feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise.\n    'Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,' said Ron", "gt": "happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to everyone's plates.\n    'Yeah, he swung it for me,' said Harry.

Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.\n    On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig's owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.\n    'Booklists have arrived,' he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. 'About time, I thought they'd forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this...'\n    Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron's head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter. It contained two pieces of parchment: one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.\n    'Only two new ones,' he said, reading the list, The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk, and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.'\n    Crack.\n    Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn't even fall off his chair.\n    'We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally\n    'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George.\n    'And about time too,' said Fred.\n    'What d'you mean?' Harry asked, jumping down beside them.\n    Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, 'and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.'\n    'Not surprising, is it, when you look at what's happened to the last four?' said George.\n    'One sacked, one dead, one's memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,' said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. 'Yeah, I see what you mean.'\n    'What's up with you, Ron?' asked Fred.\n    Ron did not answer. Harry looked round. Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.\n    'What's the matter?' said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.\n    Fred's mouth fell open, too.\n    'Prefect?' he said, staring incredulously at the letter. 'Prefect?'\n    George leapt forwards, seized the envelope in Ron's other hand and turned it upside-down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into George's palm.\n    'No way,' said George in a hushed voice.\n    'There's been a mistake,' said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark.

It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Marry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect's badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.\n    Mrs Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o'clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.\n    'Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,' she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.\n    Down in the basement Mrs Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read:\nCONGRATULATIONS\nRON AND HERMIONE\nNEW PREFECTS\nShe looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday.\n    'I thought we'd have a little party not a sit-down dinner,' she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny as they entered the room.

'Fourth prefect in the family!' she said fondly, ruffling Ron's hair.\n    'Prefect, eh?' growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin.\n    'Well, congratulations,' said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, 'authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn't have appointed you...'\n    Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother.

'We'd better get these upstairs...'\n    Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to him that Mr and Mrs Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?\n    Standing where the twins had left him, with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolts deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter.\n    '... why Dumbledore didn't make Potter a prefect?' said Kingsley.\n    'He'll have had his reasons,' replied Lupin.\n    'But it would've shown confidence in him. It's what I'd've done,' persisted Kingsley,''specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at him every few days...'\n    Harry did not look round; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he had heard. Though not remotely hungry, he followed Mundungus back towards the table. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.\n    Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken-leg with what remained of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.\n    '... the handle's made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control -'Ron was saying to Tonks.\n    Mrs Weasley yawned widely.\n    'Well, I think I'll sort out that Boggart before I turn in...

'Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn't had the manners to return my best one... thought people might like to see it.'\n    Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.\n    'There's me,' said Moody, unnecessarily pointing at himself. The Moody in the picture was unmistakeable, though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact.

Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down.

Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs and on to the floor.\n    'That was funny!'\n    Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron's face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backwards and forwards, clutching her sides.\n    'Are you taking the mickey?' said Ron, frowning at her.\n    'Baboon's... backside!' she choked, holding her ribs.\n    Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it.

Hermione had been right... Sirius should not have come. What if Mr Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco? What if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy's use of the word 'dogging' been a coincidence?\n    The weather remained undecided as they travelled further and farther north.

The horse was there in front of him, gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them, vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet, unless Ron was faking - and it was a very feeble joke if he was - Ron could not see it at all.\n    'Shall we get in, then?' said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him.\n    'Yeah,' said Harry. 'Yeah, go on...'\n    'It's all right,' said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach's dark interior. 'You're not going mad or anything. I can see them, too.'\n    'Can you?' said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes.\n    'Oh, yes,' said Luna, 'I've been able to see them ever since my first day here. They've always pulled the carriages.

You know - from his mission - the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore.'\n    'Yeah... yeah, that'll be it,' said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid's absence.\n    'Who's that?' she said sharply, pointing towards the middle of the staff table.\n    Harry's eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the centre of the long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat. Dumbledore's head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry thought, like somebody's maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.\n    'It's that Umbridge woman!'\n    'Who?' said Hermione.\n    'She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!'\n    'Nice cardigan,' said Ron, smirking.\n    'She works for Fudge!' Hermione repeated, frowning. 'What on earth's she doing here, then?'\n    'Dunno...'\n    Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed.\n    'No,' she muttered, 'no, surely not...'\n    Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid's. That meant the first-years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the Entrance Hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first-years entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim.\n    The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first-years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back.\n    The first-years' faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling. Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged.\n    The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the hat's brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song:\nIn times of old when I was new\nAnd Hogwarts barely started\nThe founders of our noble school\nThought never to be parted:\nUnited by a common goal,\nThey had the selfsame yearning,\nTo make the world's best magic school\nAnd pass along their learning.\n'Together we will build and teach!'\nThe four good friends decided\nAnd never did they dream that they\nMight some day be divided,\nFor were there such friends anywhere\nAs Slytherin and Gryffindor?\nUnless it was the second pair\nOf Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?\nSo how could it have gone so wrong?\nHow could such friendships fail?\nWhy, I was there and so can tell\nThe", "gt": "whole sad, sorry tale.\nSaid Slytherin, 'We'll teach just those\nWhose ancestry is purest.'\nSaid Ravenclaw, 'We'll teach those whose\nIntelligence is surest.'\nSaid Gryffindor, 'We'll teach all those\nWith brave deeds to their name,'\nSaid Hufflepuff, 'I'll teach the lot,\nAnd treat them just the same.'\nThese differences caused little strife\nWhen first they came to light,\nFor each of the four founders had\n", "response": "whole sad, sorry tale.\nSaid Slytherin, 'We'll teach just those\nWhose ancestry is purest.'\nSaid Ravenclaw, 'We'll teach those whose\nIntelligence is surest.'\nSaid Gryffindor, 'We'll teach all those\nWith brave deeds to their name,'\nSaid Hufflepuff, 'I'll teach the lot,\nAnd treat them just the same.'\nThese differences caused little strife\nWhen first they came to light,\nFor each of the four founders had a house", "rougeL": 0.9857142857142858, "rougeL_recall": 1.0, "rouge1": 0.9857142857142858, "rouge1_recall": 1.0}, {"prompt": "rip near the brim opened again and shouted:\n    'Gryffindor!'\n    Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor house as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again.\n    Slowly, the long line of first-years thinned. In the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat's decisions, Harry could hear Ron's stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, 'Zeller, Rose' was Sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the Hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet.\n    Whatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his Headmaster, Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all. Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises, like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their Headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.\n    'To our newcomers,' said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, 'welcome! To our old hands - welcome back! There is a time for speech-making, but this is not it. Tuck in!'\n    There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate - for food had appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice.\n    'Excellent,' said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.\n    'What were you saying before the Sorting?' Hermione asked the ghost. 'About the Hat giving warnings?'\n    'Oh, yes,' said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm. 'Yes, I have heard the Hat give several warnings before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of course, its advice is the same: stand together, be strong from within.'\n    'Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?' said Ron.\n    His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all.\n    'I beg your pardon?' said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, 'How can it know if the school's in danger if it's a Hat?'\n    'I have no idea,' said Nearly Headless Nick. 'Of course, it lives in Dumbledore's office, so I daresay it picks things up there.'\n    'And it wants all the houses to be friends?' said Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. 'Fat chance.'\n    'Well, now, you shouldn't take that attitude,' said Nick reprovingly. 'Peaceful co-operation, that's the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.'\n    'Only because you're terrified of him,' said Ron.\n    Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.\n    Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my veins -'\n    'What blood?' asked Ron. 'Surely you haven't still got -?'\n    'It's a figure of speech!' said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck.

She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull learned-by-heart sound to them.\n    The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.'\n    Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back to her. Professor McGonagall's dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little 'hem, hem' and went on with her speech.\n    'Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay. There again, progress for progress's sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation...'\n    Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put t heir heads together, whispering and giggling. Over on the Ravenclaw table Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile, at the Hufflepuff table Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect's badge gleaming on his chest.\n    Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though, judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste.\n    '... because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognised as errors of judgement. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.'\n    She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.\n    Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,' he said, bowing to her.

A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories; on the other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard. Harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys' dormitories; he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him.\n    Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then whether he was being paranoid.\n    'Hi,' he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.\n    'Hey, Harry,' said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours. 'Good holiday?'\n    'Not bad,' muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. 'You?'\n    'Yeah, it was OK,' chuckled Dean. 'Better than Seamus's, anyway, he was just telling me.'\n    'Why, what happened, Seamus?' Neville asked as he placed his Mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.\n    Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, 'Me mam didn't want me to come back.'\n    'What?' said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.\n    'She didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts.'\n    Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry.\n    'But - why?' said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus's mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursleyish.\n    Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas.\n    'Well,' he said in a measured voice, I suppose... because of you.'\n    What d'you mean?' said Harry quickly.\n    His heart was beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.\n    Well,' said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry's eye, she... er... well, it's not just you, it's Dumbledore, too...'\n    'She believes the Daily Prophet?' said Harry. 'She thinks I'm a liar and Dumbledore's an old fool?'\n    Seamus looked up at him.\n    'Yeah, something like that.'\n    Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down on to his bedside table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas. He was sick of it: sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to... Mrs Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought savagely.\n    He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, 'Look... what did happen that night when... you know, when... with Cedric Diggory and all?'\n    Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard.\n    'What are you asking me for?' Harry retorted. 'Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why don't you? That'll tell you all you need to know.'\n    'Don't you have a go at my mother,' Seamus snapped.\n    'I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,' said Harry.\n    'Don't talk to me like that!'\n    'I'll", "gt": "talk to you how I want,' said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table.

Harry, Ron and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner towards them.\n    'Hello, Harry!'\n    It was Cho Chang and, what was more, she was on her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.\n    'Hi,' said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you're not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.\n    'You got that stuff off, then?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. 'So, did you... er... have a good summer?'\n    The moment he had said this he wished he hadn't - Cedric had been Cho's boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry's. Something seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, 'Oh, it was all right, you know...'\n    'Is that a Tornados badge?' Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho's robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold 'T' was pinned. 'You don't support them, do you?'\n    'Yeah, I do,' said Cho.\n    'Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?' said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.\n    'I've supported them since I was six,' said Cho coolly. 'Anyway... see you, Harry.'\n    She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron.\n    'You are so tactless!'\n    'What?

They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snapes dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.\n    And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape's classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn't she? She had been Cedric's girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric's death... yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second time in two days... and at this", "gt": "thought, Harry's spirits rose.

His potion had been no worse than Ron's, which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs; or Neville's, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which\n    Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron; yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving zero marks for the day's work. He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape's desk with filled and corked flagons.

Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.\n    'How can Dumbledore have let this happen?' Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. 'How can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our OWL year, too!'\n    'Well, we've never had great Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?' said Harry.

He underlined the title, then looked up expectantly at Hermione.\n    'So, what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?'\n    But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of innocent-looking first-years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.\n    'No, I'm sorry, they've gone too far,' she said, standing up and looking positively furious. 'Come on, Ron.'\n    'I - what?' said Ron, plainly playing for time. 'No - come on, Hermione - we can't tell them off for giving out sweets.'\n    'You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or - or Puking Pastilles or - '\n    'Fainting Fancies?' Harry suggested quietly.\n    One by one, as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet, the first-years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right on to the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first-years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, 'She's got it under control,' before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.\n    That's enough!'

He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that when the morning came, he would regret not finishing his homework that night, he piled his books back into his bag.\n    'I'm going to bed too.'\n    He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.\n*\nThe following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one.

They didn't look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.'\n    Hermione did not speak to him all morning.\n    Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of OWLs.\n    'What you must remember,' said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk, 'is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so. And in :he meantime, I'm afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!'\n    They then spent over an hour revising Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their OWL, and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of Charms homework.\n    It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.\n    'You cannot pass an OWL,' said Professor McGonagall grimly, 'without serious application, practice and study. I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.' Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. 'Yes, you too, Longbottom,' said Professor McGonagall. There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL.'\n    She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising, though Ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon.\n    Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making.

Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death Eater after all; what if he had information about Hagrid's fate that had not yet reached the ears of the Order? He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a Bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said.\n    'Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,' said Hermione at once. 'It's just playing into Malfoy's hands to look worried; it tells him we don't know exactly what's going on. We've got to ignore him, Harry.

Harry dropped it. Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the Forest, a little moving stick-man soon swallowed up among the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds, Harry rolled up his blood-stained Bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in Hermione's handkerchief, and Malfoy's derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.\n    'If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time...' said Harry through gritted teeth.\n    'Harry, don't go picking a row with Malfoy, don't forget, he's a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you...'\n    'Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life?' said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together, they traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.\n    'I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that's all,' said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. 'And don't say that Grubbly-Plank woman's a better teacher!' he added threateningly.\n    'I wasn't going to,' said Hermione calmly.\n    'Because she'll never be as good as Hagrid,' said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.\n    The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth-years spilled out of it, including Ginny.\n    'Hi,' she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose, and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch.

When he knocked on the door she called, 'Come in,' in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around.\n    He had known this office under three of its previous occupants.\n    In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody's days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment.\n    Now, however, it looked totally unrecognisable. The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.\n    'Good evening, Mr Potter.'\n    Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.\n    'Evening, Professor Umbridge,' Harry said stiffly.\n    'Well, sit down,' she said, pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.\n    'Er,' said Harry, without moving. 'Professor Umbridge.

The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him, broke into a run.\n*\nHe had not had time to practise Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a dishevelled Ron keeping him company.\n    'How come you didn't do it last night?' Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about 'doing other stuff, bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words.\n    'That'll have to do,' he said, slamming the diary shut. 'I've said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can't make anything weird out of that, can she?'\n    They hurried off to North Tower together.\n    'How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make you do?'\n    Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, 'Lines.'\n    That's not too bad, then, eh?' said Ron.\n    'Nope,' said Harry.\n    'Hey - I forgot - did she let you off for Friday?'\n    'No,' said Harry.\n    Ron groaned sympathetically.\n    It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practised Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday's Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.\n    'I'm in detention!' Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. 'D'you think I'd rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?'\n    'At least it's only lines,' said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. 'It's not as it it's a dreadful punishment, really...'\n    Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge's room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.\n    'I can't believe how much homework we've got,' said Ron miserably.\n    'Well, why didn't you do any last night?' Hermione asked him. 'Where were you, anyway?'\n    'I was... I fancied a walk,' said Ron shiftily.\n    Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment.\n*\nThe second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harry's hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed. Harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no gasp of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but 'good evening' and 'goodnight'.\n    His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed", "gt": ", but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay.

There was a pause, during which he stared at the words carved into the skin, then, looking sick, he released Harry\n    'I thought you said she was just giving you lines?'\n    Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge's office.\n    The old hag!' Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame. 'She's sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!'\n    'No,' said Harry at once. 'I'm not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she's got to me.'\n    'Got to you?

He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since June.\n    'Well, I reckon you should -'Ron began, but he was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, 'Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?'\n*\nFriday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the Great Hall, it was without any real hope of seeing Hagrid, and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge.\n    Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron's tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.\n    At five o'clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge's office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, and was told to enter. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.\n    'You know what to do, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him.\n    Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right... on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table, he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.\n    I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh.\n    I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.\n    I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist.\n    He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared to watch. Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn't Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood.\n    I must not tell lies.\n    I must not tell lies.\n    He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it; when he could hear the scratching of Umbridge's quill", "gt": "or the opening of a desk drawer.

'I'm just so - so - so tired,' she yawned. 'I was up until one o'clock making more hats. They're disappearing like mad!'\n    And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.\n    'Great,' said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. 'Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge's office and she touched my arm...'\n    Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished, she said slowly, 'You're worried You-Know-Who's controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?'\n    'Well,' said Harry, dropping his voice, 'it's a possibility, isn't it?'\n    'I suppose so,' said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. 'But I don't think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he's properly alive again now, isn't he, he's got his own body, he wouldn't need to share someone else's. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose...'\n    Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, 'But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn't Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn't got anything to do with\n    Umbridge at all, maybe it's just coincidence it happened while you were with her?'\n    'She's evil,' said Harry flatly. Twisted.'\n    'She's horrible, yes, but... Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.'\n    It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron.\n    'I'm not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it's not a big deal. It's been hurting on and off all summer - it was just a bit worse tonight, that's all - '\n    'Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this - '\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, before he could stop himself, 'that's the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn't it, my scar?'\n    'Don't say that, it's not true!'\n    'I think I'll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks - '\n    'Harry, you can't put something like that in a letter!' said Hermione, looking alarmed. 'Don't you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can't guarantee owls aren't being intercepted any more!'\n    'All right, all right, I won't tell him, then!' said Harry irritably. He got to his feet. 'I'm going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?'\n    'Oh no,' said Hermione, looking relieved, 'if you're going that means I can go too, without being rude. I'm absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it's quite fun, I'm getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.'\n    Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.\n    'Er... no, I don't think I will, thanks,' he said. 'Er - not tomorrow. I've got loads of homework to do...'\n    And he traipsed off to the boys' stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed.\n- CHAPTER FOURTEEN -\nPercy and Padfoot\nHarry was first", "gt": "to wake up in his dormitory next morning.

She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.\n    'I'm not doing anything wrong,' Harry called after her. She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.\n    The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.\n    There you are,' he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. 'Get down here, I've got a letter for you.'\n    With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder.\n    'Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,' he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, 'but it's for Sirius, OK?'\n    She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.\n    'Safe flight, then,' said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid's hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.\n    The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later... then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged hcrse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leahery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.\n    The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands.\n    'Hi,' said Harry automatically.\n    'Oh... hi,' she said breathlessly. 'I didn't think anyone would be up here this early... I only remembered five minutes ago, it's my mum's birthday'\n    She held up the parcel.\n    Right,' said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind.\n    Nice day,' he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the weather...\n    'Yeah,' said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. 'Good Quidditch conditions. I haven't been out all week, have you?'\n    'No,' said Harry.\n    Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel.\n    'Hey has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?' she asked.\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.

Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. 'Why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that?'\n    Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter.

Ron, who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful.\n    'Pass it on, Ron,' called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.\n    Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George...\n    'Hey, Potter, how's your scar feeling?' called Malfoy.

It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year. By the evening, Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.\n    'You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week, Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall's long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra's equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter's many moons.\n    'Yeah,' said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. 'Listen... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she's done?'\n    Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.\n    'No,' he said heavily, 'you know she won't let us.'\n    And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker. Slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again. At half past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning.\n    'Nearly done?'\n    'No,' said Ron shortly.\n    'Jupiter's biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,' she said, pointing over Ron's shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, 'and it's lo that's got the volcanoes.'\n    Thanks,' snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.\n    'Sorry, I only - '\n    'Yeah, well, if you've just come over here to criticise - '\n    'Ron - '\n    'I haven't got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I'm up to my neck in it here - '\n    'No - look!'\n    Hermione was pointing to the nearest window.

Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin.\n    Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses.\n    'We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,' she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. 'Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each others latest night-time visions with the aid of the Oracle.'\n    She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left towards Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream.\n    Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was already making notes on her clipboard. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in \"Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there.

Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.\n    'Wands away,' she instructed them all with a smile, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out, sadly returned them to their bags.

There will be no need to talk.'\n    Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again.\n    Professor Umbridge had noticed, too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, 'What is it this time, Miss Granger?'\n    'I've already read Chapter Two,' said Hermione.\n    'Well then, proceed to Chapter Three.'\n    'I've read that too. I've read the whole book.'\n    Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly.\n    'Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counter-jinxes in Chapter Fifteen.'\n    'He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,' said Hermione promptly. 'He says \"counter-jinx\" is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.'\n    Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed, against her will.\n    'But I disagree,' Hermione continued.\n    Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder.\n    'You disagree?' she repeated.\n    'Yes, I do,' said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class. 'Mr Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.'\n    'Oh, you do, do you?' said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. 'Well, I'm afraid it is Mr Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.'\n    'But -'Hermione began.\n    That is enough,' said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. 'Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor house.'\n    There was an outbreak of muttering at this.\n    'What for?' said Harry angrily.\n    'Don't you get involved!' Hermione whispered urgently to him.\n    'For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,' said Professor Umbridge smoothly.

Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an 'A'.\n    'Right then, everyone, listen closely - Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention - most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell.

You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.'\n    Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously.\n    Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.\n    'As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a. much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So - you know the incantation, let me see what you can do...'\n    'How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!' Harry muttered to Ron under his breath, but he was grinning - his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated.\n    Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she realised Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while sitting in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, she rose with a grim expression on her face.\n    'Well, it's a start,' said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.\n    As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbndge approach the teachers desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.\n    'How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts? Professor Umbridge asked.\n    Thirty-nine years this December,' said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut.\n    Professor Umbridge made a note.\n    'Very well,' she said, 'you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\n    'I can hardly wait,' said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off towards the door. 'Hurry up, you three,' she added, sweeping Harry, Ron and Hermione before her.\n    Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return.\n    He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong.

They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the Murtlap essence to the bowl.\n    He was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.\n- CHAPTER SIXTEEN -\nIn the Hog's Head\nHermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to Vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.\n    'I was wondering,' Hermione said suddenly, 'whether you'd thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry.'\n    'Course I have,' said Harry grumpily, 'can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us - '\n    'I meant the idea Ron and I had -'Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look. She frowned at him, '- Oh, all right, the idea I had, then - about you teaching us.'\n    Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind.\n    He had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters - found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons...\n    'Well,' he said slowly, when he could no longer pretend to find Asiatic Anti-Venoms interesting, 'yeah, I - I've thought about it a bit.'\n    'And?' said Hermione eagerly.\n    'I dunno,' said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.\n    'I thought it was a good idea from the start,' said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation", "gt": "now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again.\n    Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n    'You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?'\n    'Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, 'but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are.

I mean, he hasn't got the Mark, for one thing.'\n    'I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly. 'Dumbledore'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn't like what he hears.'\n    When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.'\n    'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.\n    'Don't worry, Harry,' Hermione said quietly. 'You've got enough on your plate without Sirius, too.'\n    She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.\n    The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Alter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.\n    When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.\n    'Er - why was Filch sniffing you?' asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at: a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.\n    'I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh. T forgot to tell you...'\n    And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.\n    'He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him off?'\n    'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging. 'Maybe Malfoy he'd think it was a laugh.'\n    They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes.\n    'Malfoy?' said Hermione, sceptically. 'Well... yes... maybe...'\n    And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.\n    'Where are we going, anyway?' Harry asked. The Three Broomsticks?'\n    'Oh - no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 'no, it's always packed and really noisy. I've told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road. I think it's a bit... you know... dodgy... but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard.'\n    They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar's severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in", "gt": "the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.\n    'Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously.

A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\n    First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.\n    'A couple of people?' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. 'A couple of people?'\n    'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily. 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?'\n    The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.\n    'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have... twenty-five Butterbeers, please?'\n    The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.\n    'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out. 'Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these...'\n    Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\n    'What have you been telling people?' he said in a low voice. 'What are they expecting?'\n    'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'\n    'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.\n    Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\n    In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\n    'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. 'Well - er - hi.'\n    The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\n    'Well... erm... well, you know why you're here.

In any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.\n    'Well, we've all turned up to learn from him and now he's telling us he can't really do any of it,' he said.\n    That's not what he said,' snarled Fred.\n    'Would you like us to clean out you: ears for you?' enquired Greorge, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags.\n    'Or any part of your body, really", "gt": ", we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred.\n    'Yes, well, said Hermione hastily, moving on... the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?'\n    There was a murmur of general agreement.

For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.\n    'Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,' said Hermione. 'We'll send a message round to everybody when we've got a time and a place for the first meeting.'\n    She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.\n    'I - I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,' she took a deep breath, 'that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing. So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we're up to.'\n    Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.\n    'Er...' said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him, 'well... I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.'\n    But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.\n    'I - well, we are prefects,' Ernie burst out. 'And if this list was found... well, I mean to say... you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out - '\n    'You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,' Harry reminded him.\n    'I - yes,' said Ernie, 'yes, I do believe that, it's just - '\n    'Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around?' said Hermione testily.\n    'No. No, of course not,' said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. 'I - yes, of course I'll sign.'\n    Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. When the last person - Zacharias - had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.\n    'Well, time's ticking on,' said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. 'George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we'll be seeing you all later.'\n    In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too.\n    Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.\n    'Well, I think that went quite well,' said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry and Ron were clutching their bottles of Butterbeer.\n    'That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance.\n    'I don't like him much, either,' admitted Hermione, 'but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really - I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn't have come if he hadn't been going out with Ginny - '\n    Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed Butterbeer down his front.\n    'He's WHAT?' spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef.

He bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase.\n    He was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide like a helter-skelter. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry's feet.\n    'Er - I don't think we're allowed in the girls' dormitories,' said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.\n    Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.\n    'Oooh. who tried to get upstairs?' they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.\n    'Me,' said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled.

'She hasn't inspected Binns yet... bet you anything she's there...'\n    But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione's frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.\n    'What?'\n    She pointed at the window. Harry looked round. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn't she delivered the letter then, as usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too.\n    'Oh, I've always loved that owl, she's so beautiful,' Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.\n    He glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class's attention was even less focused upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly.\n    He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg.\n    Only then did he realise that Hedwig's feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle.\n    'She's hurt!' Harry whispered, bending his head low over her. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill. 'Look - there's something wrong with her wing - '\n    Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.\n    'Professor Binns,' said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him. 'I'm not feeling well.'\n    Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people.\n    'Not feeling well?' he repeated hazily.\n    'Not at all well,' said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back. 'I think I need to go to the hospital wing.'\n    'Yes,' said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. 'Yes... yes, hospital wing... well, off you go, then, Perkins...'\n    Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns's door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.\n    He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid's cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staff room. He set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.\n    Two stone gargoyles flanked the staff-room door. As Harry approached, one of them croaked, 'You should be in class, Sonny Jim.'\n    This is urgent,' said Harry curtly.\n    'Ooooh, urgent, is it?' said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice.

She looked uneasy. 'I just hope nobody else has read this...'\n    'But it was still sealed and everything,' said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her. 'And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn't know where we'd spoken to him before, would they?'\n    T don't know,' said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, 'it wouldn't be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic... and if anyone's watching the Floo Network... but I don't really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted, too!'\n    They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them, lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape's classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.\n    'Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning.

'It's what he wants.'\n    'I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction, 'if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance... from what my father says, they've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years... and as for Potter... my father says it's a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St Mungo's... apparently they've got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.'\n    Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.\n    Something collided hard with Harry's shoulder, knocking him sideways. A split second later he realised that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.\n    'Neville, no!'\n    Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville's robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.\n    'Help me!' Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville's neck and dragging him backwards, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron seized Neville's arms, and together he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Nevilles face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth.\n    'Not... funny... don't... Mungo's... show... him...'\n    The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville.\n    'Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?' Snape said in his cold, sneering voice. 'Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter", "gt": ", or it will be detention.

'You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them homework and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end.\n    'Maybe I'll skive off Divination,' he said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. 'I'll pretend to be ill and do Snape's essay instead, then I won't have to stay up half the night.'\n    'You can't skive off Divination,' said Hermione severely.\n    'Hark who's talking, you walked oui of Divination, you hate Trelawney!' said Ron indignantly.\n    'I don't hate her,' said Hermione loftily. 'I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. But Harry's already missed History of Magic and I don't think he ought to miss anything else today!'\n    There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of The Dream Oracle. Harry thought he'd surely be much better employed doing Snape's\n    punishment essay than sitting here trying to nnd meaning in a lot of made-up dreams.\n    It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus's head, and thrust the final one into Neville's chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe.\n    'Well, carry on!' said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hysterical, 'you know what to do! Or am I such a sub-standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?'\n    The class stared perplexedly at her, then at each other. Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teachers chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron's and muttered, 'I think she's got the results of her inspection back.'\n    'Professor?' said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). 'Professor, is there anything - er - wrong?'\n    'Wrong!' cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. 'Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly... insinuations have been made against me... unfounded accusations levelled... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not!'\n    She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses.\n    'I say nothing,' she choked, 'of sixteen years of devoted service... it has passed, apparently, unnoticed... but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!'\n    'But, Professor, who's insulting you?' asked Parvati timidly.\n    The Establishment!' said Professor Trelawney, in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice.

'Hermione, they've made about twenty-six Galleons already.'\n    It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed, then Fred, Lee and George sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves. At long last, Fred had closed the doorway to the boys' dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire.\n    'Sirius!' he said.\n    Harry whipped round. Sirius's untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.\n    'Hi,' he said, grinning.\n    'Hi,' chorused Harry, Ron and Hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius's.\n    'How're things?' said Sirius.\n    'Not that good,' said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. The Ministry's forced through another decree, which means we're not allowed to have Quidditch teams - '\n    'Or secret Defence Against the Dark Arts groups? Said Sirius.\n    There was a short pause.\n    'How did you know about that?' Harry demanded.\n    'You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,' said Sirius, grinning still more broadly. The Hog's Head, I ask you.'\n    'Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!' said Hermione defensively. That's always packed with people - '\n    'Which means you'd have been harder to overhear,' said Sirius. 'You've got a lot to learn, Hermione.'\n    'Who overheard us?' Harry demanded.\n    'Mundungus, of course,' said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. 'He was the witch under the veil.'\n    That was Mundungus?' Harry said, stunned.

'Keeping an eye on you, of course.'\n    'I'm still being followed?' asked Harry angrily.\n    'Yeah, you are,' said Sirius, 'and just as well, isn't it, if the first thing you're going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group.'\n    But he looked neither angry nor worried. On the contrary, he was looking at Harry with distinct pride.\n    'Why was Dung hiding from us?' asked Ron, sounding disappointed.

Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.\n    'Why did he -?'\n    Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.\n    A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.\n    The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys' dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge's hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.\n- CHAPTER EIGHTEEN -\nDumbledore's Army\n'Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There's no other explanation.'\n    'You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?' he said, outraged.\n    'I'm almost certain of it,' said Hermione grimly. 'Watch your frog, it's escaping.'\n    Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table - 'Accio!' - and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.\n    Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.\n    'I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered. 'I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all - it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights? Harry, you're squashing your frog.'\n    Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.\n    'It was a very, very close call last night,' said Hermione. 'I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silendo.'\n    The bullfrog on which she was practising her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.\n    'If she'd caught Snuffles - '\n    Harry finished the sentence for her.\n   '- He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.' He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.\n    'Silencio!' said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry's frog, which deflated silently before them. 'Well, he mustn't do it again, that's all. I just don't know how we're going to let him know. We can't send him an owl.'\n    'I don't reckon he'll risk it again,' said Ron.

Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully.\n    'You don't think he has become... sort of... reckless... since he's been cooped up in Grimmauld Place?

The sky was a deep, thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary.

Harry was thinking hard. What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough?\n    '... he's got other plans... plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed... stuff he can only get by stealth... like a weapon. Something he didn't have last time.'\n    Harry had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry interference... but now they came back to him and made him wonder... Voldemort s anger would make sense if he was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon, whatever it was. Had the Order thwarted him, stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now?\n    'Mimbulus mimbletonia,' said Ron's voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room.\n    It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she was not around, because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore, too. Ron kept throwing him anxious glances, but Harry pulled out his Charms books and set to work on finishing his essay, though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time Ron said he was going up to bed, too, he had written hardly anything.\n    Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it.\n    These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness...\n   ...

He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione's whispered in his ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted, and had Snape's essay to finish.\n    'Not tonight, Dobby,' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. This is really important...

He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens; the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the Fat Lady's portrait.\n    That was really, really good, Harry,' said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left.\n    'Yeah, it was!' said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone", "gt": "behind them.

I prefer your way,' said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his; Galleon into his pocket. 'I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them.'\n    'Fat chance,' said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air, 'I haven't got any real Galleons to confuse it with.'\n    As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their DA meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game; the: Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their own side victorious. Harry realised how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.\n    I think you've got enough to be getting on with at the moment,' she; said loftily. Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, 'I've become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practise, won't you?'\n    Snape was no less obviously partisan; he had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eye-witnesses who insisted they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.\n    Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindors chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team. Admittedly, Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after he'd made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form; during one memorable practice he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goalhoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the centre hoop at the other end; the rest of the team felt this save compared favourably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting he was related to them, something they assured him they had been trying to deny for four years.\n    The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide comments for over four years, so whispers of, 'Hey, Potty, I heard Warrington's sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday', far from chilling", "gt": "his blood, made him laugh. 'Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,' he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson's face.\n    But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers and intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh-years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, 'G", "response": "his blood, made him laugh. 'Warrington'\u30db' said Harry, 'he's about as dangerous as a potato peeler - '\n    'Don't laugh at him!' Hermione said sharply to Ron, who was looking positively agog at Harry's reaction.\n    'It's the same sort of thing as with Krum,' said Harry, 'he's not really a Death Eater, he's just saying he is to get people off their guard - '\n    'Don't you think it's a bit odd,' said Hermione, '", "rougeL": 0.16774193548387095, "rougeL_recall": 0.16883116883116883, "rouge1": 0.2838709677419355, "rouge1_recall": 0.2857142857142857}, {"prompt": ".\n    'Well, that's a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you're not a bit nervous,' said Hermione heartily.\n    'Hello,' said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at her and a few were openly laughing and pointing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion's head, which was perched precariously on her head.\n    'I'm supporting Gryffindor,' said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at her hat. 'Look what it does...'\n    She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump.\n    'It's good, isn't it?' said Luna happily. 'I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn't time. Anyway... good luck, Ronald!'\n    She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna's hat before Angelina came hurrying towards them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey.\n    'When you're ready,' she said, 'we're going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.'\n    'We'll be there in a bit,' Harry assured her. 'Ron's just got to have some breakfast.'\n    It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione go; up, too, and taking Harry's arm she drew him to one side.\n    'Don't let Ron see what's on those Slytherins' badges,' she whispered urgently.\n    Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate.\n    'Good luck, Ron,' said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek. 'And you, Harry - '\n    Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched on to them:\nWeasley is our King\nWith an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he hurried Ron across the Entrance Hall, clown the stone steps and out into the icy air.\n    The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns towards the stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron was listening.\n    Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help), then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle towards the pitch.\n    'OK, I've only just found out the final line-up for Slytherin,' said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment.

Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.\n    They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.\n    'Gather roun', gather roun',' Hagrid encouraged. 'Now, they'll be attracted by the smell o the meat but I'm going ter give em a call anyway, 'cause they'll like ter know it's me.'\n    He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound.\n    Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.\n    A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.\n    A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, 'Why doesn't Hagrid call again?'\n    Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.\n    'Oh, an' here comes another one!' said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery-wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. 'Now... put yer hands up, who can see 'em?'\n    Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand.

She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking.\n    Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now.\n    'You hag, you evil hag!' she whispered, as Umbridge walked towards Pansy Parkinson. 'I know what you're doing, you awiul, twisted, vicious - '\n    'Erm... anyway,' said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson,'so - Thestrals. Yeah. Well, there's loads o' good stuff abou' them...'\n    'Do you find,' said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, 'that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks?'\n    Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles.\n    'No... because... well... it sounds... like grunting a lot of the time...'\n    Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of Hagrid's face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy's answer.\n    'Er... yeah... good stuff abou' Thestrals. Well, once they're tamed, like this lot, yeh'll never be lost again. 'Mazin' sense o' direction, jus' tell 'em where yeh want ter go - '\n    'Assuming they can understand you, of course,' said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles.

In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron was going home to The Burrow. Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: :But you're coming too! Didn't I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!'\n    Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry's spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities. Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.\n    Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend: 'HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!'\n    Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking as dreamy as usual.\n    'Hello,' she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. These are nice, did you put them up?'\n    'No,' said Harry, 'it was Dobby the house-elf.'\n    'Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head. He jumped out from under it. 'Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously. 'It's often infested with Nargles.'\n    Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles are by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.\n    'Well,' said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, 'we've finally replaced you.'\n    'Replaced me?' said Harry blankly.\n    You and Fred and George,' she said impatiently. 'We've got another Seeker!'\n    'Who?' said Harry quickly.\n    'Ginny Weasley,' said Katie.\n    Harry gaped at her.\n    'Yeah, I know,' said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, 'but she's pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,' she said, throwing him a very dirty look, 'but as we can't have you...'\n    Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?\n    'And what about the Beaters? he asked, trying to keep his voice even", "gt": ".\n    'Andrew Kirke,' said Alicia without enthusiasm, 'and Jack Sloper.

'I'm really sorry to get all upset like this... I didn't mean to...'\n    She hiccoughed again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He'd have been so pleased with just a 'Merry Christmas'.\n    'I know it must be horrible for you,' she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again. 'Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die...

Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet.\n    'Mistletoe,' said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.\n    'Yeah,' said Harry. His mouth was very dry. 'It's probably full of Nargles, though.'\n    'What are Nargles?'\n    'No idea,' said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to have been Stunned. 'You'd have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.'\n    Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She was even nearer to him now. He could have counted the freckles on her nose.\n    'I really like you, Harry.'\n    He could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading through him, paralysing his arms, legs and brain.\n    She was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes...\n*\nHe returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his Transfiguration homework.\n    'What kept you?' he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione's.\n    Harry didn't answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.\n    'Are you all right, Harry?' Hermione asked, peering at him over the tip of her quill.\n    Harry gave a half-hearted shrug. In truth, he didn't know whether he was all right or not. 'What's up?' said Ron, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. What's happened?'\n    Harry didn't quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn't sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands.\n    'Is it Cho?' she asked in a businesslike way. 'Did she corner you after the meeting?'\n    Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his eye.\n    'So - er - what did she want?' he asked in a mock casual voice.\n    'She -'Harry began, rather hoarsely, he cleared his throat and tried again.

Hermione's words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho - Hogsmeade, perhaps - and being alone with her for hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened... the thought made his stomach clench painfully.\n    'Oh well,' said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, 'you'll have plenty of opportunities to ask her.'\n    'What if he doesn't want to ask her?' said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.\n    'Don t be silly, said Hermione vaguely, Harry's liked her lor ages, haven't you, Harry?'\n    He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.\n    'Who're you writing the novel to, anyway?' Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. Hermione hitched it up out of sight.\n    'Viktor.'\n    'Krum?'\n    'How many other Viktors do we know?'\n    Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius's head would appear there and give him some advice about girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last ones in the common room.\n    'Well, night,' said Hermione, yawning widely as she set off up the girls' staircase.\n    'What does she see in Krum?' Ron demanded, as he and Harry climbed the boys' stairs.\n    'Well,' said Harry, considering the matter, 'I s'pose he's older, isn't he... and he's an international Quidditch player...'\n    'Yeah, but apart from that,' said Ron, sounding aggravated. 'I mean, he's a grouchy git, isn't he?'\n    'Bit grouchy, yeah,' said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.\n    They pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence; Dean, Seamus and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his four-poster; instead, he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville's bed. If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours' time he would have kissed Cho Chang...\n    'Night,' grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.\n    'Night,' said Harry.\n    Maybe next time... if there was a next time... she'd be a bit happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him... or was she lying in bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think. Hermione's explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.\n    That's what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over on to his side, how girls' brains work... it'd be more useful than Divination, anyway...\n    Neville snuffled in his sleep.

Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore; Mr Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think'my fangs') had been poisonous? They passed Mrs Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but Professor McGonagall said, 'Shoo!' Mrs Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore s office.\n    'Fizzing Whizzbee,' said Professor McGonagall.\n    The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.\n    Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming\n    from inside the room, a positive babble of them.

As they are free to move between their own portraits, they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere...'\n    'But Mr Weasley could be anywhere!' said Harry.\n    'Please sit down, all three of you,' said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken, 'Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes. Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs.'\n    Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry's hearing. Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes's plumed golden head with one finger. The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.\n    'We will need,' Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, 'a warning.'\n    There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.\n    Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand.\n    The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air... a serpent's head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: he looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.\n    'Naturally, naturally,' murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. 'But in essence divided?'\n    Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction, Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with h.s wand: the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished.\n    Dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table. Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realising that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait., panting slightly.\n    'Dumbledore!'\n    'What news?' said Dumbledore at once.\n    'I yelled until someone came running,' said the wizard, who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him,'said I'd heard something moving downstairs - they weren't sure whether to believe me but went down to check - you know there are no portraits down there to watch from.

'Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt - '\n    'Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,' said Dumbledore, before Harry could speak. 'He has been taken to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius's house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than The Burrow. You will meet your mother there.'\n    'How're we going?' asked Fred, looking shaken. Floo powder?'\n    'No,' said Dumbledore, 'Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.' He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. \"We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back... I want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you - '\n    There was a flash of flame in the very middle of: the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.\n    'It is Fawkes's warning,' said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell. 'Professor Umbridge must know you're out of your beds... Minerva, go and head her off - tell her any story - '\n    Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.\n    'He says he'll be delighted,' said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. 'My great-great-grandson has always had an odd taste in house-guests.'\n    'Come here, then,' Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. 'And quickly, before anyone else joins us.'\n    Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore's desk.\n    'You have all used a Portkey before?' asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle. 'Good. On the count of three, then... one... two...'\n    It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said 'three', Harry looked up at him - they were very close together - and Dumbledore's clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry's face.\n    At once, Harry's scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again - and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, he would like nothing better than to strike - to bite - to sink his fangs into the man before him - '\n    '... three.'\n    Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onwards... until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground, and somewhere close at hand a voice said:\n    'Back again, the blood-traitor brats. Is it true their father's dying?'\n    'OUT!' roared a second voice.\n    Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.

They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.\n    Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands. His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr Weasley in the first place.\n    Don't be stupid, you haven't got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on his Butterbeer bottle was shaking, you were lying in bed, you weren't attacking anyone...\n    But then, what just happened in Dumbledore's office? he asked himself. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore, too...\n    He put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to, and it slopped over on to the table. No one took any notice. Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and, as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather.\n    'Fawkes!' said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. 'That's not Dumbledore s writing - it must be a message from your mother - here - '\n    He thrust the letter into Georges hand, who ripped it open and read aloud: 'Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St Mungo's now. Stay where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.'\n    George looked around the table.\n    'Still alive...' he said slowly. 'But that makes it sound...'\n    He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry, too, as though Mr Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother's letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the parchment out of George's hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.\n    If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one, he could not remember it. Sirius suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys' looks of disgust were answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, occasionally raising a bottle to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure each other that if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs Weasley must long since have arrived at St Mungo's.\n    Fred fell into a doze, his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder. Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. Harry and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting... waiting...\n    At ten past five in the morning by Ron's watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mrs Weasley entered the kitchen. She was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron and Harry half rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.\n    'He's going to be all right,' she said,", "gt": "her voice weak with tiredness.

George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his Butterbeer in one.\n    'Breakfast!' said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. 'Where's", "response": "her voice weak with tiredness. 'He's sleeping.'\n    She pointed to the bedroom door and they all entered. Mr Weasley was lying sprawled on his back with his eyes wide open.

He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house after one of the others...\n    When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St Mungo's. Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts. When Tonks and Mad-Eye turned up to escort them across London, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully,\n    that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the Underground.\n    Tonks was very interested in Harry's vision of the attack on Mr Weasley, something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing.\n    There isn't any Seer blood in your family, is there?' she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city.\n    'No,' said Harry thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted.\n    'No,' said Tonks musingly, 'no, I suppose it's not really prophecy you're doing, is it? I mean, you're not seeing the future, you're seeing the present... it's odd, isn't it? Useful, though...'\n    Harry didn't answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler 'I'llted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him. Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream, he asked Mad-Eye where St Mungo's was hidden.\n    'Not far from here,' grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. 'Wasn't easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn't have it underground like the Ministry - wouldn't be healthy. In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd.'\n    He seized Harry's shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.\n    'Here we go,' said Moody a moment later.\n    They had arrived outside a large,  old-fashioned,  red-brick department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read: 'Closed for Refurbishment'. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, 'It's never open, that place...'\n    'Right,' said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy. Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress. 'Every", "gt": "body ready?'\n    They nodded, clustering around her.

'Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai Llewellyn Ward.'\n    Thank you,' said Mrs Weasley. 'Come on, you lot.'\n    They followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature-Induced Injuries corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words: 'Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites. Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten: Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck. Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.\n    'We'll wait outside, Molly,' Tonks said.

So...'\n    She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.\n    'How're you feeling?' asked Hermione.\n    'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.\n    'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently.

Lupin flung out his right arm.\n    BANG.\n    A violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped backwards out of its way.\n    A thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said, 'Welcome to the - '\n    'Yes, yes, we know, thank you,' said Tonks swiftly.

Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus. At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts.\n    Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage, then got off to say goodbye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses flat against the windows.\n    'You'll be safe once you're in the grounds,' said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road. 'Have a good term, OK?'\n    'Look after yourselves,' said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last. 'And listen...' he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute goodbyes with Tonks, 'Harry, I know you don't like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all - Sirius included - want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?'\n    'Yeah, all right,' said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin's prematurely lined face. 'See you, then.'\n    The six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle, dragging their trunks. Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone and he half-wished, given what was coming the following evening, that he was still on board.\n*\nHarry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. His morning double-Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as ever. His mood was further lowered by the DA members constantly approaching him in the corridors between classes, asking hopefully if there would be a meeting that night.\n    'I'll let you know in the usual way when the next one is,' Harry said over and over again, 'but I can't do it tonight, I've got to go to - er - remedial Potions.'\n    'You take remedial Potions?' asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered Harry in the Entrance Hall after lunch. 'Good Lord, you must be terrible. Snape doesn't usually give extra lessons, does he?'\n    As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron g'.ared after him.\n    'Shall I jinx him? I can still get him from here,' he said, raising his wand and taking aim between Smith's shoulder blades.\n    'Forget it,' said Harry dismally. 'It's what everyone's going to think, isn't it?

'Hi.'\n    'We'll be in the library, Harry,' said Hermione firmly as she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase.\n    'Had a good Christmas?' asked Cho.\n    'Yeah, not bad,' said Harry.\n    'Mine was pretty quiet,' said Cho. For some reason, she was looking rather embarrassed. 'Erm... there's another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice?'\n    'What? Oh, no, I haven't checked the noticeboard since I got back.'\n    'Yes, it's on Valentines Day...'\n    'Right,' said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this. 'Well, I suppose you want to -?'\n    'Only if you do,' she said eagerly.\n    Harry stared. He had been about to say, 'I suppose you want to know when the next DA meeting is?' but her response did not seem to fit.\n    'I - er -'he said.\n    'Oh, it's OK if you don't,' she said, looking mortified. 'Don't worry. I - I'll see you around.'\n    She walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working frantically. Then something clunked into place.\n    'Cho!

Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.'\n    'Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?'\n    Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so.\n    The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable - when you are asleep, for instance - you are sharing the Dark Lord's thoughts and emotions. The Headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue. He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.'\n    Harry's heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.\n    'But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?' he asked abruptly. 'I don't like it much, but it's been useful, hasn't it? I mean... I saw that snake attack Mr Weasley and if I hadn't, Professor Dumbledore wouldn't have been able to save him, would he?

When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as though he weighed every word.\n    'It appears that the Dark Lord has bee a unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions, and sharing his thoughts, without his being any the wiser.

They glared at each other across the Pensieve.\n    'Professor Dumbledore says his name.' said Harry quietly.\n    'Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,' Snape muttered. 'While he may feel secure enough to use the name... the rest of us...' He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin.\n    'I just wanted to know,' Harry began again, forcing his voice back to politeness, 'why - '\n    'You seem to have visited the snake's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,' snarled Snape.

I KNOW!'\n    He was on all fours again on Snape's office floor, his scar was prickling unpleasantly, but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant. He pushed himself up again to find Snape storing at him, his wand raised. It looked as though, this time, Snape had lifted the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back.\n    'What happened then, Potter?' he asked, eyeing Harry intently.\n    'I saw - I remembered,' Harry panted.

For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished.\n    Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.\n    'And off again!' shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.\n    'How do those hats work, then?' said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely.

Hermione beamed at it.\n    'I think I'll go to bed,' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.\n    He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys' dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right.\n    He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where be was, whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own name.\n    Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears... he was happier than he had been in a very long time... jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant... a wonderful, wonderful thing had happened...\n    'Harry?

He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort's ranks.\n    He glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story there: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip o egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge. For once her pouchy toad's eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently.\n    'Oh my -'said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper.\n    'What now?' said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy.\n    'It's... horrible,' said Hermione, looking shaken.

Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand.\n*\nThe fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St Mungo's, Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had once done.\n    Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives cf their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.\n    'And I don't know how you stand it - it's horrible,' she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort.\n    It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the lone of the whisperers' voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that, suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet's version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year.\n    It was not only the students' mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching.\n    They obviously can't talk freely in the staff room any more,' said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day. 'Not with Umbridge there.'\n    'Reckon they know anything new?' said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.\n    'If they do, we're not going to hear about it, are we?' said Harry angrily.

Harry's sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving. On the contrary, Harry felt he was getting \\vorse with every lesson.\n    Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort's thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort's mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door.\n    'Maybe it's a bit like an illness,' said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron. 'A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better.'\n    The lessons with Snape are making it worse,' said Harry flatly 'I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night.' He rubbed his forehead angrily. 'I just wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at it - '\n    That's not funny,' said Hermione sharply. 'Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn't have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You're just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.'\n    'I am working!' said Harry, nettled. \"You try it some time - Snape: trying to get inside your head - it's not a bundle of laughs, you know!'\n    'Maybe...' said Ron slowly.\n    'Maybe what?' said Hermione, rather snappishly.\n    'Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind,' said Ron darkly.\n    'What do you mean?' said Hermione.\n    'Well, maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry...'\n    Harry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other.\n    'Maybe,' he said again, in a lower voice, 'he's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider... make it easier for You-Know-\n    'Shut up, Ron,' said Hermione angrily. 'How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.'\n    'He used to be a Death Eater,' said Ron stubbornly. 'And we've never seen proof that he really swapped sides.'\n    'Dumbledore trusts him,' Hermione repeated. 'And if we can't trust Dumbledore, we can't trust anyone.'\n*\nWith so much to worry about and so much to do - startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth-years working until past midnight, secret DA sessions and regular classes with Snape - 'January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in her company.\n    On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully. He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls, Hedwig was not there - not that Harry had expected her - but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down.\n    'And about time!

'Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste... at least Diggory was good-looking!'\n    The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n    'So... where d'you want to go?' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.\n    'Oh... I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging. 'Urn... shall we just have a look in the shops or something?'\n    They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, 'By Order of the Ministry of Magic', offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n    It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters,'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere...'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street. 'Yeah, that is weird.\n    He wasn't sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. The) had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren't bothering to look for them... it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.\n    The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed. Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck.\n    'Um... d'you want to get a coffee?' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n    'Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around. 'Where?'\n    'Oh, there's a really nice place just up here; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's?' she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbndge's office.\n    'Cute, isn't it?' said Cho happily.\n    'Er... yeah,' said Harry untruthfully.\n    'Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day!' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.\n    'Aaah...'\n    They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that t was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.\n    'What can I get you, m'dears?' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty.\n    Two coffees, please,' said Cho.\n    In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished", "gt": "they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete.

Several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. 'But you won't talk to me!

'I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me... how many ere you meeting after Hermione?'\n    'It's not like that!' said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake.\n    Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now.\n    'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.\n    'Cho!' Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.\n    There was total silence within the teashop. Every eye was on?larry. He threw a Galleon down on to the table, shook pink confetti out of his hair, and followed Cho out of the door.\n    It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen, he simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.\n    'Women!' he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets. 'What did she want to talk about Cedric for, anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?'\n    He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.\n    'Hi, Hagrid!' he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him.\n    Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognised him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises.\n    'Oh, it's yeh, Harry,' said Hagrid. 'Yeh all righ?'\n    'Yeah, I'm fine,' lied Harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he didn't really have much to complain about. 'Er - are you OK?'\n    'Me?' said Hagrid. 'Oh yeah, I'm grand, Harry, grand.'\n    He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry didn't know what to say to him. They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, 'In the same boat, yeh an' me, aren' we, 'Any?'\n    'Er -'said Harry.\n    'Yeah...

Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she said in a businesslike tone, 'All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing.

He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.

It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.\n    'Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.\n    'I was lucky,' she shrugged.

'She says she knows he's got it in him.'\n    Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of 'Weasley is our King' sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favourites to win the Quidditch Cup.\n    Fred and George wandered over.\n    'I haven't even got the heart to take the mickey out of him,' said Fred, looking over at Ron's crumpled figure.

'Getting mail?'\n    'Be careful, Mr Weasley or I shall have to put you in detention,' said Umbridge.

'About what happened to me last June.'\n    For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked towards the Headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.\n    'An interview?' repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever.

'He can't believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!'\n    Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS' and 'EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE' in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like 'DUNG' and 'UMBRIDGE' at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice.

His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him.

The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He seemed to be trembling.\n    'I do not blame you, Rookwood,' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice.\n    He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.\n    'You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?' asked Harry.\n    'Yes, My Lord, yes...

Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember.

'When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people touching it. That's why he was in St Mungos, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn't talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn't risk him getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he'd got his voice back, he'd explain what he'd been doing, wouldn't he? They would have known he'd been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is he?'\n    'He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,' said Harry. Tn the - hang on...' he said slowly.

So, what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move - or guessed someone was there - or just did the Imperius Curse on the off-chance there'd be a guard there?

'Rookwood used to work there... maybe Voldemort'll send Rookwood to do it?'\n    Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, she said, 'But you shouldn't have seen this at all, Harry.'\n    'What?' he said, taken aback.\n    'You're supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,' said Hermione, suddenly stern.\n    'I know I am,' said Harry.

He swished his long palomino tail, raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead, then lowered it slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars appeared on the ceiling.

'Don' worry abou' me, Harry, jus' get along now, there's a good lad.'\n    Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle.\n    Meanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them, the OWLs were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth-years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now.\n    If it had not been for the DA lessons, Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy. He sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow DA members and saw how far they had come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the DA received 'Outstanding' in their Defence Against the Dark Arts OWLs.\n    They had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practise, though, as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a Dementor.\n    'Oh, don't be such a killjoy,' said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement C-Uring their last lesson before Easter. They're so pretty!'\n    They're not supposed to be pretty, they're supposed to protect you,' said Harry patiently. 'What we really need is a Boggart or something; that's how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while t'le Boggart was pretending to be a Dementor - '\n    'But that would be really scary!' said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of the end of her wand. 'And I still - 'can't - do it!' she added angrily.\n    Neville was having trouble, Loo. His Face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip.\n    'You've got to think of something happy,' Harry reminded him.\n    'I'm trying,' said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat.\n    'Harry, I think I'm doing it!' yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to his first ever DA meeting by Dean. 'Look - ah - 'it's gone... but it was definitely something hairy, Harry!'\n    Hermione's Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gambolling around her.\n    They are sort of nice, aren't they?' she said, looking at it fondly.\n    The door of the Room of Requirement opened, and closed. Harry looked round to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he realised that the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew, something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats.\n    'Hi, Dobby!' he said.

She seized his arm in a vice-like grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy.\n    'You hop along and see if you can round up any more of them, Draco,' she said. 'Tell the others to look in the library - anybody out of breath - check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls' ones - off you go - and you,' she added in her softest, mos: dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away, 'you can come with me to the Headmaster's office, Potter.'\n    They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron - Mrs Weasley would kill him - and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her OWLs. And it had been Seamus's very first meeting... and Neville had been getting so good...\n    'Fizzing Whizzbee,' sang Umbridge; the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still holding tight to Harry.\n    The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense. Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation; Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognise, were positioned either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes.\n    The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of them were alert and serious, watching what was happening below them. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbour's ear.\n    Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face.\n    'Well,' he said. 'Well, well, well...'\n    Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.\n    'He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Umbridge. There was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the Entrance Hall. The Malfoy boy cornered him.'\n    'Did he, did he?' said Fudge appreciatively. 'I must remember to tell Lucius. Well, Potter... I expect you know why you are here?'\n    Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant 'yes': his mouth had opened and the word was half-formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry - his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder - but as Harry stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.\n    Harry changed direction mid-word.\n    'Ye - no.'\n    'I beg your pardon?' said Fudge.\n    'No,' said Harry, firmly.\n    You don t know why you are here?'\n    'No, I don't,' said Harry.\n    Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge. Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink.\n    'So you have no idea,' said Fudge, in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, 'why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office?

'What an interesting insight into our justice system!'\n    'Blatant corruption!' roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk.

He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it.\n    'Oho!' said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again. 'Yes, do let's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on - '\n    Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter's identical twin in the Hog's Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors?'\n    Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.\n    'Oh, very good, Minister, very good!'\n    Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently, too.\n    'Cornelius, I do not deny - and nor, I am sure, does Harry - 'that he was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defence Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head.'\n    Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open.\n    Umbridge recovered first.\n    That's all very fine, Headmaster,' she said, smiling sweetly, 'but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four.

'Dumbledore's Army.'\n    Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge. He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up, smiling.\n    'Well, the game is up,' he said simply. 'Would you like a written confession from me, Cornelius - or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?'\n    Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was fear in both faces.

'In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.'\n    Harry's stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes.\n    'I don't know,' he said, a little too quickly.\n    'Mr Potter,' said Umbridge, 'let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr Potter... where is Sirius Black?'\n    'No idea,' said Harry loudly. 'Haven't got a clue.'\n    They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering. Then Umbridge stood up.\n    'Very well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be warned: the might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts - except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred of evidence...'\n    BOOM!\n    The very floor of the office shook. Umbridge slipped sideways, clutching her desk for support, and looking shocked.\n    'What was -?'\n    She was gazing towards the door. Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost-full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers. He could hear people running and screaming several floors below.\n    'Back to lunch you go, Potter!' cried Umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds' start, then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was.\n    It was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.\n    Dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went; shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers; rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls; sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord; firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched.\n    Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed in horror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre; it whirled towards Umbridge and Filch with a sinister 'wheeeeeeeeee'. They both yelled with fright and ducked, and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor.\n    'Hurry, Filch, hurry!' shrieked Umbridge, 'they'll be all over the school unless we do something - Stupefy!'\n    A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets.

Smiling to himself, Harry closed his eyes...\n    The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant... or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them...\n    He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries. He was speeding towards the plain black door... let it open... let it open...\n    It did. He was inside the circular room lined with doors... he crossed it, placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards...\n    Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate... he had to go on...\n    There was a door at the far end... it, too, opened at his touch...\n    And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres... now Harry's heart was beating fast with excitement... he knew where to go... he ran forwards, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room...\n    There was something in this room he wanted very, very much...\n    Something he wanted... or somebody else wanted...\n    His scar was hurting...\n    BANG!\n    Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter.\n    'Cool!' said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window. 'I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it's like they mated, come and see!'\n    Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment... he had got so close that time.\n    Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening.\n*\nHarry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised Occlumency once since their last lesson: there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse.\n    He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good. Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class.\n    Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape's office after dinner. Halfway across the Entrance Hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him.\n    'Over here,' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood. Gryffindor's was now almost empty. 'Are you OK? Umbridge hasn't been asking you about the DA, has she?'\n    'Oh, no,' said Cho hurriedly. 'No, it was only... well, I just wanted to say...

He stopped, and stood looking at it, reminded of something... then he remembered: it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights n the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.\n    He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape's thoughts... things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's defences accidentally...\n    Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him... what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?\n    The silvery lights shivered on the wall... Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?\n    Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterwards, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter... Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right.\n    Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.\n    The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling... in fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was looking down into the Great Hall.\n    His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts... his brain seemed to be in limbo... it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do... he was trembling... Snape could be back at any moment... but Harry thought of Cho's anger, of Malfoy's jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.\n    He took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his face into the surface of Snape's thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry head-first into the Pensieve...\n    He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then - '\n    He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone. Instead, there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. It was clearly exam time.\n    Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere... this was his memory...\n    And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS - ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL.\n    So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry's own age.

'Give five signs that identify the werewolf. Excellent question.'\n    'D'you think you managed to get all the signs?' said James in tones of mock concern.\n    'Think I did,' said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. 'One: he's sitting on my chair. Two: he's wearing my clothes. Three: his name's Remus Lupin.'\n    Wormtail was the only one who didn't laugh.\n    'I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail,' he said anxiously, 'but I couldn't think what else - '\n    'How thick are you, Wormtail?' said James impatiently. 'You run round with a werewolf once a month - '\n    'Keep your voice down,' implored Lupin.\n    Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his exam questions - but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any further. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.\n    'Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,' he heard Sir us say. 'I'll be surprised if I don't get \"Outstanding\" on it at least.'\n    'Me too,' said James. He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch.\n    'Where'd you get that?'\n    'Nicked it,' said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe.\n    They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass. Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.\n    Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the Snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn't tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting Loo tidy, and he also kept looking over at the girls by the waters edge.\n    'Put that away, will you,' said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer, 'before Wormtail wets himself with excitement.'\n    Wormtail turned slightly pink, but James grinned.\n    'If it bothers you,' he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket.

He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character. Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head... he was as bad, wasn't he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it... not unless they really loathed them... perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it.\n    Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, 'What's he done to you?' And hadn't James replied, 'It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.' Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored?

Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it...\n    For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now... now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.\n    The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library.

'You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!'\n    'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly. 'Good sense of when to duck, more like.' He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad... They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'\n    'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'\n    'Hey,' said a voice in Harry's ear. He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them. 'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor. 'She says you need to talk to Sirius?'\n    'What?' said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'.\n    'Yeah...' said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '\n    'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. 'With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?'\n    'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling. 'It's a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?'\n    'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?' continued Fred. 'No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do.'\n    He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\n    'But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly. 'And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?'\n    'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'\n    'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.\n    He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative.

Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow oi dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\n    Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an 'E'.\n    He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure.\n    'Whoops,' he said softly. 'Another zero, then, Potter.'\n    Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\n    'I'm sorry!' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. I'm really sorry, Harry. I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!'\n    Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office.\n    He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\n    'Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door. 'I forgot.'\n    'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.\n    Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\n    'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\n    Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\n    'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?'\n    'Er -'said Harry.\n    He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\n    'Yes?' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\n    'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.\n    'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \"Exceeds Expectations\" grade, I see.

She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\n    'Any questions, Potter?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?'\n    'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence.

She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\n    'Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!'\n    Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge.\n    'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'\n    The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\n    There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!' shouted Professor McGonagall.\n    'Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall.

You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!'\n    'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. Totter, that concludes our careers consultation.'\n    Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\n    Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\n    'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'. 'Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already...'\n    Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking...\n    He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him... there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holid", "gt": "ays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve... nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach... and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak.\n    But the fact remained that if he was caught...\n    'Dumbledore sacrificed himself", "response": "ays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve.

Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.\n    'Sirius?'\n    The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, bu. Lupin.\n    'Harry!' he said, looking thoroughly shocked. 'What are you - 'what's happened, is everything all right?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry. 'I just wondered - I mean, I just fancied a - 'a chat with Sirius.'\n    'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, 'he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again...'\n    And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge's hard stone floor.\n    Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.\n    'What is it?' said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. 'Are you all right? Do you need help?'\n    'No,' said Harry, 'it's nothing like that... I just wanted to talk... about my dad.'\n    They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve.\n    When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, 'I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen - '\n    'I'm fifteen' said Harry heatedly.\n    'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be - he was popular, he was good at Quidditch - good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James - whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry - always hated the Dark Arts.'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.\n    'I'm not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly.\n    Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, 'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - '\n    'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius.\n    Lupin smiled.\n    'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice.\n    Sirius and Lupin laughed.\n    'I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately.\n    'Was he playing with the Snitch?' said Lupin eagerly.\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently.

He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.\n    'Approval for Whipping... Approval for Whipping... I can do it at last... they've had it coming to them for years...'\n    He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\n    Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\n    One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\n    It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered.\n    'So!' said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing\n    just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. 'So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?'\n    'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\n    Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\n    'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 'I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting... oh, let me do it now...'\n    'Very good, Argus,' she said. 'You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, 'are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.'\n    'You know what?' said Fred. 'I don't think we are.'\n    He turned to his twin.\n    'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'\n    'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly.\n    Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked Fred.\n    'Definitely,' said George.\n    And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:\n    'Accio brooms!'\n    Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\n    'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\n    'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own.\n    Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.\n    'It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - We", "gt": "asley' Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice.

Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour,\n    from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.\n    None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her.

'About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?'\n    'Course not, he'll recover,' said Ron indifferently.\n    'Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn't it?' said Harry in a satisfied voice.\n    He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands.

That's all very well, but what if Montague's permanently injured?'\n    'Who cares?' said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood up drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees. 'Montague shouldn't have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!'\n    'You?' she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs, and replacing it in front of her. 'Why should I be worried about you?'\n    'When Mum's next letter finally gets through Umbridge's screening process,' said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, 'I'm going to be in deep trouble.

He also suspected that part of his mind - the part that often spoke in Hermione's voice - now felt guilty on the occasions\n    it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach the journey's end.\n    'You know,' said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, 'if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.'\n    'Yeah, I s'pose so,' said Harry, glad of a change of subject.\n    'I mean, we've won one, lost one - if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday - '\n    'Yeah, that's right,' said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to. Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him.\n*\nThe final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron's abysmal goal-keeping record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.\n    'I mean, I can't get any worse, can I?' he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. 'Nothing to lose now, is there?'\n    'You know,' said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, 'I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence.'\n    Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head.\n    'Oh, gosh, I forgot!' said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. 'Cho will be playing, won't she?'\n    Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.\n    They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, ckar day; Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of 'Weasley is our King'.\n    Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George\n    had left, was commentating as usual.

They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the Forest.\n    'Hagrid!' said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles, over which Hagrid had stepped with ease, and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the Forest path. 'Where are we going?'\n    'Bit further,' said Hagrid over his shoulder. 'C'mon, Harry... we need ter keep together now.'\n    It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had", "gt": "to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves.

Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry, Hermione and Hagrid now stood.\n    'Sleepin',' breathed Hagrid.\n    Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work.

In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees.

They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility.\n    'Oh my!' Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.\n    The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as\n    Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.\n    'Anyway, Grawpy,' shouted Hagrid, looking", "gt": "up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, 'I've brought some friends ter meet yeh.

Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of 'Weasley is our King' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.\n    They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\n    'Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this!

'Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's.'\n    'What's she like, Neville?' asked Hermione at once. 'Is she strict?'\n    'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice.\n    'Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it?' Ron told him encouragingly.\n    'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably. 'Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad... well... you saw what she's like at St Mungo's\n    Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.\n    Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.\n    'Hermione, we wanted to buy that!' shouted Ron.\n    'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 'You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it.'\n    'Ding", "gt": "le's got powdered dragon claw?' said Ron eagerly.\n    'Not any more,' said Hermione. 'I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know.'\n    'Dragon claw does work!' said Ron.

'Is that them? Is that the examiners?'\n    Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.\n    'Shall we go and have a closer look?' said Ron.\n    Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart.\n    'Journey was fine, journey was fine, we've made it plenty of times before!' she said impatiently. 'Now, I haven't heard from Dumbledore lately!' she added, peering around the Hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. 'No idea where he is, I suppose?'\n    'None at all,' said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. 'But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough.'\n    'I doubt it,' shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, 'not it Dumbledore doesn't want to be found! I should know... examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs... did things with a wand I'd never seen before.'\n    'Yes... well...' said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, 'let me show you to the staff room. I daresay you'd like a cup of tea after your journey.'\n    It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to do some last-minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did. He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. He knew he was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.\n    None of the fifth-years talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.\n    Once breakfast was over, the fifth- and seventh-years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons; then, at half past nine, they were called forwards class by class to re-enter the Great Hall, which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were all seated and quiet, she said, 'You may begin,' and turned over an enormous hour-glass on the desk beside her, on which there were also spare quills, ink bottles and rolls of parchment.\n    Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard - three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling - and lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly.\n    Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll... smiling slightly, he bent over the paper and", "gt": "began to write.\n*\n'Well, it wasn't too bad, was it?' asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper.

For a bonus point...?'\n    Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked.\n    'Expecto patronum!'\n    His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.\n    'Excellent!' he said. 'Very well, Potter, you may go!'\n    As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on telling anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an 'Outstanding' OWL.\n    On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision. They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the Forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining - he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little - when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad-tempered.\n    'How were the Runes?' said Ron, yawning and stretching.\n    'I mis-translated ehwaz,' said Hermione furiously. 'It means partnership, not defence', I mixed it up with eihwaz.'\n    'Ah well,' said Ron lazily, 'that's only one mistake, isn't it, you'll still get - '\n    'Oh, shut up!' said Hermione angrily. 'It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what's more, someone's put another Nifiler in Umbridge's office.

And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!'\n    'He's teaching at the moment; she can't blame him,' said Harry, gesturing out of the window.\n    'Oh, you're so naive sometimes, Harry. You really think Umbridge will wait for proof?' said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off towards the girls' dormitories, banging the door behind her.\n    'Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,' said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights.\n    Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least - and which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, he found the written paper difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he could describe its effects accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year.\n    The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected, it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings, he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions.

Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.\n    Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group.\n    He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus's position. Jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.\n    He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrids windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence.\n    Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and, not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, Harry hastily bent over his star-chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.\n    He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin.\n    Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.\n    Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,' he said softly.\n    Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin.\n    'Ahem - twenty minutes to go,' said Professor Tofty.\n    Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star-chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mis-labelled Venus as Mars. He bent to correct it.\n    There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people cried 'Ouch!' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below.\n    Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him.\n    'No!' cried Hermione.\n    'My dear!' said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice.

'Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we've lost Hagrid too.'\n    They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.\n    'But why sack Hagrid now?' asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head.

'It's me who's been putting the Nifflers in her office. Fred and George left me a couple; I've been levitating them in through her window.'\n    'She'd have sacked him anyway,' said Dean.

Harry felt wide awake; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.\n    Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute revision, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common-room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the three-and-a-half-feet-high stack of notes that Hermione had lent him.\n    The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their face-down examination papers. Harry felt exhausted.

He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing.\n    Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall - it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world...\n    Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass - Umbridge jogging to keep up - their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.\n    'It's hidden in Hagrid's hut, is it?' said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear.\n    'Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly. 'Hagrid might have set it off accidentally.'\n    'Yes,' said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. 'Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf.'\n    She laughed.

'Noooooo...

Her wand fell from her hand to the ground, and Harry's heart leapt. If he could just reach it - '\n    But as he stretched out a hand towards it, a centaur's hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.\n    'Now!' roared a voice in Harry's ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright. Hermione, too, had been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-coloured backs and heads of the centaurs, Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane. Screaming non-stop, her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them.\n    'And these?' said the hard-faced, grey centaur holding Hermione.\n    'They are young,' said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry.

Where do we go from here?'\n    'We need to get back up to the castle,' said Hermione faintly.\n    'By the time we've done that, Sirius'll probably be dead!' said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper. A high-pitched chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him.\n    'Well, we can't do anything without wands,' said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again. 'Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?'\n    'Yeah, we were just wondering that.' said a familiar voice from behind her.\n    Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees.\n    Ron came into sight, closely followed by Ginny, Neville and Luna.

'Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'How many?'\n    'Just two.'\n    'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.\n    'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling.\n    'I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting.\n    'Don't be stupid, we can't all go!' said Harry angrily. 'Look, you three -'he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, 'you're not involved in this, you're not - '\n    They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge.

That's probably why these two turned up in the first place.'\n    Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood.\n    'OK, then,' he said, a bright idea occurring, 'Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she'll attract more Thestrals - '\n    'I'm not staying behind!' said Hermione furiously.\n    There's no need,' said Luna, smiling. 'Look, here come more now... you two must really smell...'\n    Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.\n    'All right,' he said angrily, 'pick one and get on, then.'\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR -\nThe Department\nOf Mysteries\nHarry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse's silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.\n    He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed and staring.\n    'What?' he said.\n    'How're we supposed to get on?' said Ron faintly.

Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back, looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box, both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.\n    Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement.\n    'Never again,' he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to stride away from his Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost tell over again. Never, ever again... that was the worst - '\n    Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him: both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground; Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly.\n    'Where do we go from here, then?' she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip.\n    'Over here,' he said. He gave his Thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door. 'Come on!' he urged the others, as they hesitated.\n    Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna.\n    'Whoever's nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!' he said.\n    Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial; as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box.\n    'Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.'\n    'Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,' Harry said very quickly, 'Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood... we're here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!'\n    Thank you,' said the cool female voice. 'Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes.'\n    Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head; he glanced at the topmost one, Harry Potter, Rescue Mission.\n    'Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.'\n    'Fine!' Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. 'Now can we move?'\n    The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.\n    A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed, to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.\n    The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,' said the woman's voice.\n    The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, closely followed by Neville and Luna.

He swallowed. 'In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room - that's this one - and then I went through another door into a room that kind of... glitters. We should try a few doors,' he said hastily, 'I'll know the right way when I see it.

The place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid, big enough for all of them to swim in; a number of pearly-white objects were drifting around lazily in it.\n    'What're those things?' whispered Ron.\n    'Dunno,' said Harry.\n    'Are they fish?' breathed Ginny.\n    'Aquavirius Maggots!' said Luna excitedly.

I wonder what they're doing with them?'\n    Harry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily, they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid, looking something like slimy cauliflowers.\n    'Let's get out of here,' said Harry. This isn't right, we need to try another door.'\n    There are doors here, too,' said Ron, pointing around the walls. Harry's heart sank; how big was this place?\n    'In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,' he said. 'I think we should go back and try from there.'\n    So they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry's eyes instead of the blue candle flames.\n    'Wait!' said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them. 'Flagrate!'\n    She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery 'X' appeared on the door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue and, when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door they had already tried.\n    'Good thinking,' said Harry. 'OK, let's try this one - '\n    Again, he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open, his wand still raised, the others at his heels.\n    This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the centre of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre, or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot. Instead, of a chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit, on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing.

What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife, he saw the blade had melted.\n    'Right, we're leaving that room,' said Hermione decisively.\n    'But what if that's the one?' said Ron, staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing.\n    'It can't be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,' said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket.\n    'You know what could be in there?' said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again.\n    'Something blibbering, no doubt,' said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.\n    The wall slid to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the next door open.\n    This is it!'\n    He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light. As Harry's eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare, he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.\n    'This way!'\n    Harry's heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track; he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.\n    'Oh, took!' said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar.\n    Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the jar, it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.\n    'Keep going!' said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird.\n    'You dawdled enough by that old arch!' she said crossly, but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.\n    This is it,' Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech, 'it's through here - '\n    He glanced around at them all; they had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door and pushed. It swung open.\n    They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty glass orbs.

They were trapped, and outnumbered two to one.\n    'To me,' said Malfoy yet again.\n    'Where's Sirius?'

He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard's desk, which burst into flame.\n    Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it - an oddly chilling sound.\n    'You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?' called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. 'Above such brutality, are you?'\n    'We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,' Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall.

Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to gel out from behind it.

This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.\n    Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike - '\n    There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.\n    'Look out!'

At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement - the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass.\n    For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass - '\n    Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.\n    'MASTER!' screamed Bellatrix.\n    Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: 'Stay where you are, Harry!'\n    For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened.

'Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own - '\n    That's enough, Phineas,' said Dumbledore.\n    Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window.

He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.'\n    The sun had risen fully now: Dumbledore's office was bathed in it. The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes.\n    The prophecy's smashed,' Harry said blankly. 'I was pulling Neville up those benches in the - the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell...'\n    The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.'\n    'Who heard it?' asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already.\n    'I did,' said Dumbledore. 'On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer and I thought it common politeness to meet her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.'\n    Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch. He bent down, slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.\n    A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin. But when Sybill Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before:\n    'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...'\n    The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished.\n    The silence within the office was absolute.

It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.'\n    Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died... More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, The end of the prophecy... it was something about... neither can live...'\n    '... while the other survives,' said Dumbledore.\n    'So,' said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him,'so does that mean that... that one of us has got to kill the other one... in the end?'\n    'Yes,' said Dumbledore.\n    For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone for ever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already; even now a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark...\n    'I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,' said Dumbledore hesitantly. 'You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect?

'He's really, really miserable, actually...' She lowered her voice to a whisper. 'He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts...'\n    All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him - nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.\n    'Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione.\n    'Sulking, more like,' said Ginny.\n    'Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.\n    'Anything wrong, Professor?' called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.\n    'No... no...' said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows. 'No, I must have been dreaming...'\n    Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.\n    'Speaking of centaurs,' said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, 'who's Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?'\n    'He's got to,' said Harry, 'the other centaurs won't take him back, will they?'\n    'It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,' said Ginny.\n    'Bet Dumbledore wishes he could've got rid of Trelawney for good,' said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. 'Mind you, the whole subject's useless if you ask me, Firenze isn't a lot better...'\n    'How can you say that?' Hermione demanded. 'After we've just found out that there are real prophecies?'\n    Harry's heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way...\n    'It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.\n    'Yeah, it is,' said Ron. 'Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going?' he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.\n    'Er - Hagrid's,' said Harry. 'You know, he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are.'\n    'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond.

Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.\n    Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started.\n    'Just do it tomorrow!' said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory.

He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it.\n    He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. 'Use it if you need me, all right?'\n    Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.\n    He turned the mirror over.

He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.\n    He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:\n    'Sirius Black!'\n    Nothing happened.

He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.\n    He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady's corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him it was Luna. There were no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment.\n    'Hello,' said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice.\n    'How come you're not at the feast?'

It was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for Luna.\n    'How come people hide your stuff?' he asked her, frowning.\n    'Oh... well...' she shrugged.

Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight.\n    'What's - er - going on with you and her, anyway?' Ron asked quietly.\n    'Nothing,' said Harry truthfully.\n    'I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively.\n    Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days... the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.\n    'You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully.

Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.\n    'Michael Corner,' she said.\n    'Michael - but -'said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her. 'But you were going out with him!'\n    'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely. 'He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.' She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.\n    'Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,' he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle. 'Good for you.

Rowling\n\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ONE - THE RIDDLE HOUSE\n\u3000\u3000The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it \"the Riddle House,\" even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\n\u3000\u3000The Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was \"creepy.\" Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.\n\u3000\u3000The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.\n\u3000\u3000The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!\"\n\u3000\u3000The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs.\n\u3000\u3000Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\n", "gt": "\u3000\u3000The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders.

The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\n\u3000\u3000Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\n\u3000\u3000It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.\n\u3000\u3000Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.\n\u3000\u3000Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.\n\u3000\u3000The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.\n\u3000\u3000He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\n\u3000\u3000On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\n\u3000\u3000The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" said a second voice. This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up. \"Move me", "gt": "closer to the fire, Wormtail.\"\n\u3000\u3000Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is Nagini?\"", "response": "closer to the fire, Wormtail.\"\n\u3000\u3000Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.

I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective.

If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I am a faithful servant,\" said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I found you,\" said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now. \"I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That is true,\" said the second man, sounding amused. \"A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Liar,\" said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever. \"However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"R-really, My Lord?

Your part will come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You...you...\" Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. \"You...are going...to kill me too?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wormtail, Wormtail,\" said the cold voice silkily, \"why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless.

The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.\n\u3000\u3000And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWO - THE SCAR\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.\n\u3000\u3000He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.\n\u3000\u3000Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.\n\u3000\u3000harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he didn't...He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...\n\u3000\u3000The dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a snake on a hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort.

They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.\n\u3000\u3000And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents...\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his\n\u3000\u3000wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.\n\u3000\u3000It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.\n\u3000\u3000But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?\n\u3000\u3000At once, Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.\n\u3000\u3000\"Your scar hurt? Harry, that's really serious.... Write to Professor Dumbledore!\n\u3000\u3000And I'll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.... Maybe there's something in there about curse scars....\"\n\u3000\u3000Yes, that would be Hermione's advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.\n\u3000\u3000Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.\n\u3000\u3000But what would he write?\n\u3000\u3000Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.\n\u3000\u3000Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.\n\u3000\u3000Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.\n\u3000\u3000And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley", "gt": "'s, reaction, and in a moment, Ron's red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.\n\u3000\u3000\"Your scar hurt?

Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South. Sirius's letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to right now, all right...\n\u3000\u3000Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Sirius, Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't going too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off things.\n\u3000\u3000I'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.\n\u3000\u3000A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?\n\u3000\u3000I'll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she's off hunting at the moment.\n\u3000\u3000Say hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the dream; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection he\n\u3000\u3000started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER THREE - THE INVITATION\n\u3000\u3000By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley's plate with a tremulous \"There you are, Diddy darling,\" Dudley glowered at her.\n\u3000\u3000His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn't understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that \"he didn't want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.\" They also skated over the accusations of bullying in", "gt": "the report - \"He's a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn't hurt a fly!\" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.\n\u3000\u3000However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away.

She didn't have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.\n\u3000\u3000\"You,\" he barked at Harry. \"In the living room. Now.\"\n\u3000\u3000Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. \"So.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry would have dearly loved to have said, \"So what?\" but he didn't feel that Uncle Vernon's temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.\n\u3000\u3000\"This just arrived,\" said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple writing paper at Harry. \"A letter. About you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud:\n\u3000\u3000Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\n\u3000\u3000I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.\n\u3000\u3000It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.\n\u3000\u3000Hoping to see Harry soon, Yours sincerely, Molly Weasley P.S. I do hope we've put enough stamps on.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at this,\" he growled.\n\u3000\u3000He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley's letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys' address in minute writing.\n\u3000\u3000\"She did put enough stamps on, then,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs.\n\u3000\u3000Weasley's was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle's eyes flashed.\n\u3000\u3000\"The postman noticed,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That's why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary. Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral. If he\n\u3000\u3000didn't do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry decided to break the silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"So - can I go then?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon's large purple face. The mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon's most fundamental instincts came into conflict.

He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon's thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn't go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would know\n\u3000\u3000Harry was being mistreated. There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle's mind as though the great mustached face were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible.\n\u3000\u3000And then -\"\n\u3000\u3000Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy... this stupid... this World Cup thing. You write and tell these - these Weasleys they're to pick you up, mind. I haven't got time to go dropping you off all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your - your godfather... tell him... tell him you're going.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay then,\" said Harry brightly.\n\u3000\u3000He turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going... he was going to the Weasleys', he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!\n\u3000\u3000Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was an excellent breakfast, wasn't it?\" said Harry. \"I feel really full, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley's face, Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.\n\u3000\u3000The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"OUCH!\" said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry bent down, recognized Ron's handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily scribbled note.\n\u3000\u3000Harry - DAD GOT THE TICKETS - Ireland versus Bulgaria, Monday night. Mum's writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already have the letter, I don't know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I'd send this with Pig anyway.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at the word \"Pig,\" then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never seen anything that looked less like a pig.\n\u3000\u3000Maybe he couldn't read Ron's writing. He went back to the letter:\n\u3000\u3000We're coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can't miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it's better if we pretend to ask their permission first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we'll come and get you at five o'clock on Sunday anyway.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's arriving this afternoon.

Don't mention anything about Abroad while you're here unless you want the pants bored off you.\n\u3000\u3000See you soon - Ron \"Calm down!\" Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. \"Come here, I need you to take my answer back!\"\n\u3000\u3000The owl fluttered down", "gt": "on top of Hedwig's cage.

Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.\n\u3000\u3000Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn't even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn't, eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be driving, of course?\" Uncle Vernon barked across the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000He hadn't thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up? They didn't have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?\n\u3000\u3000\"I think so,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.\n\u3000\u3000Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn't stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn't take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.\n\u3000\u3000But five o'clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're late!\" he snarled at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000I know,\" said Harry. \"Maybe - er - the traffic's bad, or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ten past five... then a quarter past five... Harry was starting to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.\n\u3000\u3000\"No consideration at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We might've had an engagement.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe they think they'll get invited to dinner if they're late.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, they most certainly won't be,\" said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room. \"They'll take the boy and go, there'll be no hanging around.

They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley brightly. \"Got your trunk ready?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's upstairs,\" said Harry, grinning back.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll get it,\" said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the room. They knew where Harry's bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night.\n\u3000\u3000Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. \"Very - erm - very nice place you've got here.\"\n\u3000\u3000As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn't go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon's face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.\n\u3000\u3000\"They run off eckeltricity, do they?\" he said knowledgeably. \"Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,\" he added to Uncle Vernon. \"And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I'm mad, but there you are.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal\n\u3000\u3000himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yep,\" said Harry, \"that's Dudley.\"\n\u3000\u3000He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.\n\u3000\u3000\"Having a good holiday, Dudley?\" he said kindly.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley whimpered.

Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys' kitchen fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did he eat it?\" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee \"Yeah,\" said Harry, straightening up. \"What was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ton-Tongue Toffee,\" said Fred brightly. \"George and I invented them, and we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer....\"\n\u3000\u3000The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.\n\u3000\u3000\"How're you doing, Harry?\" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.\n\u3000\u3000Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was - there was no other word for it - cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring", "gt": "with what looked like a fang dangling from it.

Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them.

Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up, Pig,\" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \"Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\" he told Harry. \"Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - why are you calling that owl Pig?\" Harry asked Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because he's being stupid,\" said Ginny, \"Its proper name is Pigwidge", "gt": "on.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"Ginny named him,\"\n\u3000\u3000he explained to Harry. \"She reckons it's sweet.

Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know where we went wrong with them,\" said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. \"It's been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to - OH NOT AGAIN!\"\n\u3000\u3000She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.\n\u3000\u3000\"One of their fake wands again!\" she shouted. \"How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around?\"\n\u3000\u3000She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \"let's go and help Bill and Charlie.\"\n\u3000\u3000They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.\n\u3000\u3000They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out of the air. Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.\n\u3000\u3000Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy's head poking out of a window on the second floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Will you keep it down?!\" he bellowed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry, Perce,\" said Bill, grinning. \"How're the cauldron bottoms coming on?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very badly,\" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.\n\u3000\u3000By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and\n\u3000\u3000salad.\n\u3000\u3000At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told Mr. Crouch that I'll have it ready by Tuesday,\" Percy was saying pompously.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things.

Only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer.

There are places Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry's been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can't have too many clogging up their buses and trains - remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there's a handy wood they're using as the Apparition point. For those who don't want to Apparate, or can't, we use Portkeys.\n\u3000\u3000They're objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time.

His feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then -His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,\" said a voice.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SEVEN - BAGMAN AND CROUCH\n\u3000\u3000Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly:\n\u3000\u3000The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.\n\u3000\u3000\"Morning, Basil,\" said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello there, Arthur,\" said Basil wearily. \"Not on duty, eh? It's all right for\n\u3000\u3000some.... We've been here all night.... You'd better get out of the way, we've got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen.

After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon.

You couldn't wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.\"\n\u3000\u3000They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Always the same,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \"We can't resist showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.\"\n\u3000\u3000They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY.\n\u3000\u3000\"Couldn't have a better spot!\" said Mr. Weasley happily. \"The field is just on the other side of the wood there, we're as close as we could be.\" He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. \"Right,\" he said excitedly, \"no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we're out in these numbers on Muggle land. We'll be putting these tents up by hand!\n\u3000\u3000Shouldn't be too difficult.... Muggles do it all the time.... Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.\n\u3000\u3000All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll be a bit cramped,\" he called, \"but I think we'll all squeeze in. Come and have a look.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs. Figg's house:\n\u3000\u3000There were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it's not for long,\" said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. I borrowed this from Perkins at the office.

He's really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just put them on, Archie, there's a good chap. You can't walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate's already getting suspicious -\n\u3000\u3000I bought this in a Muggle shop,\" said the old wizard stubbornly. \"Muggles wear them.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,\" said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not putting them on,\" said old Archie in indignation. \"I like a healthy breeze 'round my privates, thanks.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.\n\u3000\u3000Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry's House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back. More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who d'you reckon they are?\" he said. \"They don't go to Hogwarts, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Spect they go to some foreign school,\" said Ron. \"I know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil... this was years and years ago... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn't afford it.

By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.\n\u3000\u3000Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes - green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria - which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\n\u3000\u3000\"Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,\" Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker.

Can't get another position, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why not?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, \"He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Paying?\" said Harry blankly. \"Well - why shouldn't he be paid?\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.\n\u3000\u3000\"House-elves is not paid, sir!\" she said in a muffled squeak. \"No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\" said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \"House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter\" - she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped - \"but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights?\" said Harry, frowning.\n\u3000\u3000\"Master - master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,\" said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \"Winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told.

Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy's lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn't dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Weasley and continued down the line to his seats.

Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\"\n\u3000\u3000The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans - A Risk With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.\n\u3000\u3000\"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce... the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\"\n\u3000\u3000The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wonder what they've brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \"Aaah!\"\n\u3000\u3000He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are veel -?\"\n\u3000\u3000But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women... the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen..\n\u3000\u3000. except that they weren't - they couldn't be - human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind... but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.\n\u3000\u3000The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen.\n\u3000\u3000And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now.\n\u3000\u3000Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea... but would it be good enough?\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione's voice from a long way off.\n\u3000\u3000The music stopped.

Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.\n\u3000\u3000\"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose.\n\u3000\u3000The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\n\u3000\u3000HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran.\n\u3000\u3000One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!\"\n\u3000\u3000shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\n\u3000\u3000Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy - Mullet - Mo ran!\" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.\n\u3000\u3000The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration.

Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Foul!\" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.\n\u3000\u3000\"Foul!\" echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice. \"Dimitrov skins Moran -deliberately flying to collide there - and it's got to be another penalty - yes, there's the whistle!\"\n\u3000\u3000The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders -\"\n\u3000\u3000And that, boys,\" yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \"is why you should never go for looks alone!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above.

Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground.

Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused.

Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\" one of them shouted. \"I'm a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, you're not!\" yelled his friend. \"You're a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron....\n\u3000\u3000but I'm a vampire hunter, I've killed about ninety so far -\"\n\u3000\u3000A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \"I'm about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron's face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \"Did I tell you I've invented a broomstick that'll reach Jupiter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Honestly!\" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We'll hear anyone coming a mile off.\"\n\u3000\u3000The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\n\u3000\u3000Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \"What are you doing in here, all alone?\"\n\u3000\u3000They looked at one another, surprised.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - there's a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Bagman stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"At the campsite... some", "gt": "people have got hold of a family of Muggles...\n\u3000\u3000Bagman swore loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\n\u3000\u3000\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \"", "response": "people have got hold of a family of Muggles, I think...\n\u3000\u3000Bagman swore loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\n\u3000\u3000\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of", "rougeL": 0.9733333333333334, "rougeL_recall": 0.9733333333333334, "rouge1": 0.9733333333333334, "rouge1_recall": 0.9733333333333334}, {"prompt": "\u3000\"Voldemort's - \"Harry, come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of them\n\u3000\u3000started across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Without pausing to think, he yelled, \"DUCK!\"\n\u3000\u3000He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"STUPEFY!\" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness-- \"Stop!\" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That's my son!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand.

He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch's face was taut with rage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which of you did it?\" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. \"Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't do that!\" said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't do anything!\" said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. \"What did you want to attack us for?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do not lie, sir!\" shouted Mr. Crouch.

You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy -\"\n\u3000\u3000But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione's words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're too late,\" said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head. \"They'll have Disapparated.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so,\" said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard.

There's a good chance we got them...\n\u3000\u3000\"Amos, be careful!\" said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness.

Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be all right,\"", "gt": "said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. \"Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while...and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible.

We'll go on to the Burrow in the meantime.\"\n\u3000\u3000They trudged through the thickening mist, the ground becoming increasingly muddy as they walked. They could hear splashing water somewhere to their right, and thought that Mustafa was out in his bath again.\n", "rougeL": 0.2690058479532164, "rougeL_recall": 0.25842696629213485, "rouge1": 0.3859649122807018, "rouge1_recall": 0.3707865168539326}, {"prompt": "\n\u3000\u3000\"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: 'If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.' Oh really,\" said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \"Nobody was hurt.\n\u3000\u3000What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods...\n\u3000\u3000well, there certainly will be rumors now she's printed that.\"\n\u3000\u3000He heaved a deep sigh. \"Molly, I'm going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with you, Father,\" said Percy importantly. \"Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck.

With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up, Harry?\" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something I haven't told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"But - he wasn't there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him... him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill...someone.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn't bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but was it, though?\" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It's weird, isn't it?... My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't - say - his - name!\" Ron hissed through gritted teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"And remember what Professor Trelawney said?\" Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \"At the end of last year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts.

Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you two up to?\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins.\n\u3000\u3000\"Homework,\" said Fred vaguely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be ridiculous, you're still on holiday,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, we've left it a bit late,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?\" said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly. \"You wouldn't be thinking of restarting Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, Mum,\" said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. \"If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation?\"\n\u3000\u3000Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh your father's coming!\" she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley's hand had suddenly spun from \"work\" to \"traveling\"; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on \"home\" with the others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Coming, Arthur!\" called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room.\n\u3000\u3000A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the fat's really in the fire now,\" he told Mrs. Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower. \"Rita Skeeter's been ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry mess-ups to report.

I got some for Harry too... show him, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn't as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn't have any lace on them at all - in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought they'd bring out the color of your eyes, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley fondly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, they're okay!\" said Ron angrily, looking at Harry's robes. \"Why couldn't I have some like that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because... well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn't a lot of choice!\"\n\u3000\u3000said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked away.

And, Harry, make sure you get a picture of him.\n\u3000\u3000Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\"\n\u3000\u3000She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why is everything I own rubbish?\" said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon's beak.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ELEVEN - ABOARD THE HOGWART EXPRESS\n\u3000\u3000There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\n\u3000\u3000He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur!\" she called up the staircase. \"Arthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers - \"I've got a quill here somewhere!\" - and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to -Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.\n\u3000\u3000Amos Diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what-d'you-call-'ems - please-men. Arthur, you've got to get over there --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here!\" said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it's a real stroke of luck I heard about it,\" said Mr. Diggory's head. \"I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does Mad-Eye say happened?\" asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory's head rolled its eyes. \"Says he heard an intruder in his yard.

He was an Auror - one of the best... a Dark wizard catcher,\" he added, seeing Harry's blank look \"Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though... the families of people he caught, mainly...\n\u3000\u3000and I heard he's been getting really paranoid in his old age. Doesn't trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards everywhere.\"\n\u3000\u3000Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King's Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just can't justify taking more time off at the moment,\" he told them. \"Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, you know what, Percy?\" said George seriously. \"I reckon he'll know your name soon.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. \"But there weren't any to spare.... Oh dear, they don't look happy, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster's Fabulous No-Heat, Wet-Start Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred's trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man's leg.\n\u3000\u3000The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King's Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it... and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\n\u3000\u3000\"I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,\" said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Fred keenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll see,\" said Charlie. \"Just don't tell Percy I mentioned it... it's 'classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,' after all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,\" said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why", "gt": "?\" said George impatiently.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to have an interesting year,\" said Bill, his eyes twinkling. \"I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A bit of what?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of", "response": "?\" said George impatiently.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to have an interesting year,\" said Bill, his eyes twinkling. \"I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A bit of what?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window", "rougeL": 0.9866666666666666, "rougeL_recall": 1.0, "rouge1": 0.9866666666666666, "rouge1_recall": 1.0}, {"prompt": "said Hermione matter-of-factly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come off it,\" said Ron, starting to laugh. \"Durmstrang's got to be about the same size as Hogwarts -- how are you going to hide a great big castle?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Hogwarts is hidden,\" said Hermione, in surprise. \"Everyone knows that... well, everyone who's read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Just you, then,\" said Ron. \"So go on - how d'you hide a place like Hogwarts?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's bewitched,\" said Hermione. \"If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So Durmstrang'll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe,\" said Hermione, shrugging, \"or it might have Muggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they'll have made it Unplottable -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come again?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you can enchant a building so it's impossible to plot on a map, can't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er... if you say so,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,\" said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Somewhere very cold, because they've got fur capes as part of their uniforms.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, think of the possibilities,\" said Ron dreamily. \"It would've been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident.... Shame his mother likes him..\n\u3000\u3000..\"\n\u3000\u3000The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north. The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.\n\u3000\u3000Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking \"Troy - Mullet - Moran!\" but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way.\n\u3000\u3000After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.\n\u3000\u3000Neville listened jealously to the others' conversation as they relived the Cup match.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gran didn't want to go,\" he said miserably. \"Wouldn't buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was,\" said Ron. \"Look at this, Neville...\n\u3000\u3000He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh wow,\" said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"We saw him right up close, as well,\" said Ron. \"We were in the Top Box -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.\"\n\u3000\u3000Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer.

Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey,\" said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, \"if that keeps up the lake's going to overflow.

People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.\n\u3000\u3000\"PEEVES!\" yelled an angry voice. \"Peeves, come down here at ONCE!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch - sorry, Miss Granger -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's all right, Professor!\" Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peeves, get down here NOW!\" barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat\n\u3000\u3000and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not doing nothing!\" cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. \"Already wet, aren't they?

Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school - all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid's moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited.

A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks.

As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mornin'!\" Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Be'er wait fer the Slytherins, they won' want ter miss this - Blast-Ended Skrewts!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come again?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid pointed down into the crates.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eurgh!\" squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward. \"Eurgh\" just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry's opinion. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.\n\u3000\u3000\"On'y jus' hatched,\" said Hagrid proudly, \"so yeh'll be able ter raise 'em yerselves!\n\u3000\u3000Thought we'd make a bit of a project of it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And why would we want to raise them?\" said a cold voice.\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherins had arrived.

He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all....\n\u3000\u3000So that was how his parents had died... exactly like that spider.

How Voldemort had killed Harry's father first.\n\u3000\u3000How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run...

When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right -\"\n\u3000\u3000But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry's face and didn't speak again until\n\u3000\u3000they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney's predictions tonight, since they would take hours.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron's conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we'd seen the curses?\" Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, probably,\" said Ron. \"But Dumbledore's always done things his way, hasn't he, and Moody's been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks questions later - look at his dustbins. Balderdash.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shall we get our Divination stuff, then?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I s'pose,\" Ron groaned.\n\u3000\u3000They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody's lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.\n\u3000\u3000\"You all right, Neville?\" Harry asked him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" said Neville, \"I'm fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me...\"\n\u3000\u3000He held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology,\" Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. \"He thought I'd like this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything.\n\u3000\u3000It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry's brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney's fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't got a clue what this lot's supposed to mean,\" he said, staring down at a long list of calculations.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know,\" said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, \"I think it's back to the old Divination standby.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What - make it up?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.\n\u3000\u3000\"Next Monday,\" he said as he scribbled, \"I am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.\" He looked up at Harry. \"You know her - just put in loads of misery, she'll lap it up.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire. \"Okay... on Monday, I will be in danger of- er - burns.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, you will be,\" said Ron darkly", "gt": ", \"we're seeing the skrewts again on Monday.

The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hedwig!\" he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window.\n\u3000\u3000Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of Harry's predictions.\n\u3000\u3000\"About time!\" said Harry, hurrying after her.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's got an answer!\" said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig's leg.\n\u3000\u3000Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What does it say?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\n\u3000\u3000The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry read it aloud:\n\u3000\u3000Harry - I'm flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here.

Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius's reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a lie, Harry,\" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. \"You didn't imagine your scar hurting and you know it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So what?\" said Harry. \"He's not going back to Azkaban because of me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Drop it,\" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.\n\u3000\u3000Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session.\n\u3000\u3000On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody's Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\u3000\u3000To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects.\n\u3000\u3000\"But - but you said it's illegal, Professor,\" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \"You said - to use it against another human was -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\" said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \"If you'd rather learn the hard way - when someone's putting it on you so they can control you completely - fine by me. You're excused. Off you go.\"\n\u3000\u3000He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.\n\u3000\u3000Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem.\n\u3000\u3000Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter,\" Moody growled, \"you next.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, '1mperio!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him.\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk... jump onto the desk...\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.\n\u3000\u3000Jump onto the desk....\n\u3000\u3000Why, though?

Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody's punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.\n\u3000\u3000When they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two:\n\u3000\u3000TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT THE DELEGATIONS FROM BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG WILL BE ARRIVING AT 6 O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE 30TH OF OCTOBER.

You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Hermione. \"I've heard he's a really good student - and he's a prefect.\"\n\u3000\u3000She spoke as though this settled the matter.\n\u3000\u3000\"You only like him because he's handsome,\" said Ron scathingly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me, I don't like people just because they're handsome!\" said Hermione indignantly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like \"Lockhart!\"\n\u3000\u3000The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts\n\u3000\u3000champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves.\n\u3000\u3000Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning.\n\u3000\u3000Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces.

A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.\n\u3000\u3000Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, of course not,\" said Hermione curtly, \"I hardly think students are supposed to -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we have,\" said George, indicating Fred, \"loads of times, to nick food.

Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry's shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled off Sirius's reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius's letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Nice try, Harry.\n\u3000\u3000I'm back in the country and well hidden.

A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he's hiding... I mean, they're not native birds, are they?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something. He couldn't deny either that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn't have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks, Hedwig,\" he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery.\n\u3000\u3000There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter.

She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.\n\u3000\u3000Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear Madame Maxime,\" he said. \"Welcome to Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbly-dort,\" said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. \"I 'ope I find you well?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"In excellent form, I thank you,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"My pupils,\" said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what\n\u3000\u3000Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime's enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"As Karkaroff arrived yet?\" Madame Maxime asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"He should be here any moment,\" said Dumbledore. \"Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Warm up, I think,\" said Madame Maxime. \"But ze 'orses -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,\" said Dumbledore, \"the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other - er - charges.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Skrewts,\" Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"My steeds require - er - forceful 'andling,\" said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job.\n\u3000\u3000\"Zey are very strong....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\" said Dumbledore, smiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well,\" said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. \"Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It will be attended to,\" said Dumbledore, also bowing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come,\" said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"How big d'you reckon Durmstrang's horses are going to be?\" Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won't be able to handle them,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Harry. \"That's if he hasn't been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what's up with them?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe they've escaped,\" said Ron hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh don't say that,\" said Hermione with a shudder. \"Imagine that lot loose on the grounds....\"\n\u3000\u3000They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.\n\u3000\u3000For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime's huge horses snorting and stamping.

Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not that cold,\" said Hermione defensively. \"Why didn't they bring cloaks?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Over here!

Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, that's right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,\" said Ron scathingly. \"I bet Krum can see right through him, though... bet he gets people fawning over him all the time....\n\u3000\u3000Where d'you reckon they're going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry... I wouldn't mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione snorted.\n\u3000\u3000\"They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,\" said Harry. The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.\n\u3000\u3000Up at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore's.\n\u3000\u3000\"But there are only two extra people,\" Harry said. \"Why's Filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Eh?\" said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.\n\u3000\u3000When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore's left-hand side.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and - most particularly - guests,\" said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. \"I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.\"\n\u3000\u3000One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one's making you stay!\" Hermione whispered, bristling at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,\" said Dumbledore. \"I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!\"\n\u3000\u3000He sat down, and", "gt": "Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.\n\u3000\u3000The plates in front of them filled with food as usual.

A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment has come,\" said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. \"The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The what?\" Harry muttered.\n\u3000\u3000Ron shrugged.\n\u3000\u3000\"- just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation\" - there was a smattering of polite applause - \"and Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard's robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore's long white hair and beard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,\" Dumbledore continued, \"and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions' efforts.\"\n\u3000\u3000At the mention of the word \"champions,\" the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, \"The casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.\"\n\u3000\u3000Filch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old.\n\u3000\u3000A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else's.\n\u3000\u3000\"The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,\" said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, \"and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways.. their magical prowess - their daring -their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.\"\n\u3000\u3000At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.\n\u3000\u3000\"As you know, three champions compete in the tournament,\" Dumbledore went on calmly, \"one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,\" said Dumbledore. \"Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours", "gt": "in which to put their names forward.

You're blocking the doorway.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another's shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.\n\u3000\u3000Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.\n\u3000\u3000As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.\n\u3000\u3000\"Anyone put their name in yet?\" Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000\"All the Durmstrang lot,\" she replied. \"But I haven't seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,\" said Harry. \"I would've if it had been me... wouldn't have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?\"\n\u3000\u3000Someone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.\n\u3000\u3000\"Done it,\" Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Just taken it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Aging Potion, dung brains,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"One drop each,\" said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. \"We only need to be a few months older.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Lee, grinning broadly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not sure this is going to work, you know,\" said Hermione warningly. \"I'm sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. \"C'mon, then - I'll go first -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley - Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second Harry thought it had worked - George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred - but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.\n\u3000\u3000The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other's beards.\n\u3000\u3000\"I did warn you,\" said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. \"I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey.

The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid's front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knocked on Hagrid's door, and Fang's booming barks answered instantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bout time!\" said Hagrid, when he'd flung open the door. \"Thought you lot'd forgotten where I live!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've been really busy, Hag -\" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn't the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but found he had too much hair. The look didn't really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \"Erm - where are the skrewts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\" said Hagrid happily. \"They're get-tin' massive, mus' be\n\u3000\u3000nearly three foot long now.

Still got abou' twenty.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's lucky,\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wait,\" he said, grinning. \"You jus' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh've never seen before.

Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.\n\u3000\u3000At long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,\" said Dumbledore. \"I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions' names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber\" - he indicated the door behind the staff table - \"where they will be receiving their first instructions.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone watched, waiting.... A few people kept checking their watches...\n\u3000\u3000\"Any second,\" Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.\n\u3000\u3000The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it.\n\u3000\u3000Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it - the whole room gasped.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm's length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.\n\u3000\u3000\"The champion for Durmstrang,\" he read, in a strong, clear voice, \"will be Viktor Krum.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No surprises there!\" yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall.\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bravo, Viktor!\" boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. \"Knew you had it in you!\"\n\u3000\u3000The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.\n\u3000\u3000\"The champion for Beauxbatons,\" said Dumbledore, \"is Fleur Delacour!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's her, Ron!\" Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw", "gt": "and Hufflepuff tables.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh look, they're all disappointed,\" Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. \"Disappointed\" was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.\n\u3000\u3000When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it.

He wasn't smiling.\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved off along the teachers' table. Hagrid was seated right at\n\u3000\u3000the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting.\n\u3000\u3000He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.\n\u3000\u3000The faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear.\n\u3000\u3000Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" she said. \"Do zey want us back in ze Hall?\"\n\u3000\u3000She thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn't know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.\n\u3000\u3000There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Extraordinary!\" he muttered, squeezing Harry's arm. \"Absolutely extraordinary!\n\u3000\u3000Gentlemen... lady,\" he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three.\n\u3000\u3000\"May I introduce - incredible though it may seem - the fourth Triwizard champion?\"\n\u3000\u3000Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, \"Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Joke?\" Bagman repeated, bewildered. \"No, no, not at all! Harry's name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!\"\n\u3000\u3000Krum's thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000Fleur frowned.\n\u3000\u3000\"But evidently zair 'as been a mistake,\" she said contemptuously to Bagman. \"E cannot compete. 'E is too young.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... it is amazing,\" said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. \"But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name's come out of the goblet... I mean, I don't think there can be any ducking out at this stage.... It's down in the rules, you're obliged...\n\u3000\u3000Harry will just have to do the best he --\"\n\u3000\u3000The door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Madame Maxime!\" said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress. \"Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!\"\n\u3000\u3000Somewhere under Harry's numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?\n\u3000\u3000Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled", "gt": ".\n\u3000\u3000\"What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?\" she said imperiously. \"I'd rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,\" said Professor Karkaroff.

I have half a mind to leave now!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Empty threat, Karkaroff,\" growled a voice from near the door. \"You can't leave your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk.\n\u3000\u3000\"Convenient?\" said Karkaroff. \"I'm afraid I don't understand you, Moody.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you?\" said Moody quietly. \"It's very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter's name in that goblet knowing he'd have to compete if it came out.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Evidently, someone 'oo wished to give 'Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!\" said Madame Maxime.\n\u3000\u3000\"I quite agree, Madame Maxime,\" said Karkaroff, bowing to her. \"I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If anyone's got reason to complain, it's Potter,\" growled Moody, \"but... funny thing.\n\u3000\u3000.. I don't hear him saying a word...\n\u3000\u3000\"Why should 'e complain?\" burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. \"E 'as ze chance\n\u3000\u3000to compete, 'asn't 'e?

A thousand Galleons in prize money - zis is a chance many would die for!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe someone's hoping Potter is going to die for it,\" said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.\n\u3000\u3000An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, \"Moody, old man...\n\u3000\u3000what a thing to say!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn't discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,\" said Karkaroff loudly. \"Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagining things, am I?\" growled Moody. \"Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy's name in that goblet...\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?\" said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!\" said Moody. \"It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament....

He really couldn't think of anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked.\n\u3000\u3000\"So... tell me...\" said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. \"How did you get your name in?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't,\" said Harry, staring up at him. \"I didn't put it in.

Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones.\n\u3000\u3000Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he'd put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who'd had three years' more magical education than he had - when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he'd thought about it... he'd fantasized about it..\n\u3000\u3000. but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream... he'd never really, seriously considered entering..\n\u3000\u3000But someone else had considered it... someone else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He didn't think so, somehow...\n\u3000\u3000To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish..\n\u3000\u3000But to get him killed?\n\u3000\u3000Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn't someone have put Harry's name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want him dead?\n\u3000\u3000Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old... Lord Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry's name got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone... feeble and powerless....\n\u3000\u3000Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone... he had been talking to Wormtail... plotting Harry's murder.\n\u3000\u3000Harry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor's painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, well, well,\" said the Fat Lady, \"Violet's just told me everything. Who's just been chosen as school champion, then?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Balderdash,\" said Harry dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"It most certainly isn't!\" said the pale witch indignantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, no, Vi, it's the password,\" said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.\n\u3000\u3000The blast of noise that met Harry's ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward.

Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him - only to find that Ron's bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room.\n\u3000\u3000The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. \"I brought you this.... Want to go for a walk?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good idea,\" said Harry gratefully.\n\u3000\u3000They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, of course I knew you hadn't entered yourself,\" she said when he'd finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. \"The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody's right, Harry...

At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't use you,\" Harry told her, looking around for the school owls.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to use one of these.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach.\n\u3000\u3000\"First Ron, then you,\" Harry said angrily. \"This isn't my fault.\"\n\u3000\u3000If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the\n\u3000\u3000tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.\n\u3000\u3000The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him -but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.\n\u3000\u3000He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too - the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.\n\u3000\u3000Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, look, boys, it's the champion,\" he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \"Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he's going to be around much longer.... Half the Triwizard champions have died..\n\u3000\u3000. how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task's my bet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class's horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Take this thing for a walk?\" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes.\n\u3000\u3000\"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Roun", "gt": "' the middle,\" said Hagrid, demonstrating. \"Er - yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus' as an extra precaution, like.

He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, \"So - yer competin', Harry. In the tournament. School champion.\"\n\u3000\u3000", "response": "' the middle,\" said Hagrid, demonstrating. \"Er - yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus' as an extra precaution, like.

Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon...\"\n\u3000\u3000Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday's worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning \"ignore them, ignore them, ignore them\" under her breath, and he couldn't see why today should be any better.\n\u3000\u3000When he and Hermione arrived at Snape's dungeon after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges - then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:\n\u3000\u3000SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY-- THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION!\n\u3000\u3000\"Like them, Potter?\" said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. \"And this isn't all they do - look!\"\n\u3000\u3000He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green:\n\u3000\u3000POTTER STINKS!\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh very funny,\" Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, \"really witty.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn't laughing, but he wasn't sticking up for Harry either.\n\u3000\u3000\"Want one, Granger?\" said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. \"I've got loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want a Mudblood sliming it up.\"\n\u3000\u3000Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he'd thought what he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Hermione said warningly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, then, Potter,\" Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. \"Moody's not here to look after you now - do it, if you've got the guts -\"\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, they looked into each other's eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Funnunculus!\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Densaugeo!\" screamed Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles -- Harry's hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy's hit Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were spring", "gt": "ing up -Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face.

More publicity.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good luck!\" said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked on the door and entered.\n\u3000\u3000He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them, however, had been placed end-to-end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.\n\u3000\u3000Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fheur were in conversation. Fheur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light.\n\u3000\u3000A paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.\n\u3000\u3000Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come... nothing to worry about, it's just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wand weighing?\" Harry repeated nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they're your most important tools in the tasks ahead,\" said Bagman. \"The expert's upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there's going to be a little photo shoot.

She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?\" she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. \"The youngest champion, you know... to add", "gt": "a bit of color?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly!\" cried Bagman. \"That is - if Harry has no objection?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lovely,\" said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry's upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door.\n\u3000\u3000\"We don't want to be in there with all that noise,\" she said. \"Let's see... ah, yes,", "response": "a bit of color?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly!\" cried Bagman. \"That is - if Harry has no objection?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lovely,\" said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry'\u30dboking under the chin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" said Harry. \"Er - sorry about that.

To\n\u3000\u3000live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because - \"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't enter,\" said Harry, starting to feel irritated.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you remember your parents at all?\" said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him very intently.\n\u3000\u3000Frowning, he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just written:\n\u3000\u3000Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have NOT got tears in my eyes!\" said Harry loudly.\n\u3000\u3000Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the cupboard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore!\" cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight - but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita's clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. \"How are you?\" she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. \"I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards' Conference?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Enchantingly nasty,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.\"\n\u3000\u3000Rita Skeeter didn't look remotely abashed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, Dumbhedore, and that many wizards in the street -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,\" said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, \"but I'm afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.\"\n\u3000\u3000Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, hooking up at the velvet-covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting - Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.\n\u3000\u3000\"May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?\" said Dumbledore, taking his place at the judges' table and talking to the champions. \"He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hooked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before - he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?\" said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.\n\u3000\u3000Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Olhivander and handed him her wand", "gt": ".\n\u3000\u3000\"Hmm...\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks.

Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him - this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. \"Curious,\" he had said, \"curious,\" and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort's.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry's wand than anyone else's. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you all,\" said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table. \"You may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end -\"\n\u3000\u3000Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Photos, Dumbledore, photos!\" cried Bagman excitedly. \"All the judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - yes, let's do those first,\" said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again.\n\u3000\u3000\"And then perhaps some individual shots.\"\n\u3000\u3000The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of\n\u3000\u3000the group. The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn't there - he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've had an owl,\" said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry's pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - right,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after him - he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of Sirius's answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.\n\u3000\u3000Harry - I can't say everything I would like to in a letter, it's too risky in case the owl is intercepted - we need to talk face-to-face.

Ron hadn't spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape's detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats' brains in Snape's dungeon, but that had been the day Rita's article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed Ron's belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't start this,\" Harry said stubbornly. \"It's his problem.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You miss him!\" Hermione said impatiently. \"And I know he misses you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss him?\" said Harry. \"I don't miss him...\n\u3000\u3000But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn't mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.\n\u3000\u3000Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he was up to.\n\u3000\u3000Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task?\n\u3000\u3000Hermione often complained about Krum being there - not that he ever bothered them - but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not even good-looking!\" she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum's sharp profile.\n\u3000\u3000\"They only like him because he's famous! They wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that WonkyFaint thing -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wronski Feint,\" said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron's expression if he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky-Faints.\n\u3000\u3000It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet article.\n\u3000\u3000On the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry didn't need much persuasion.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about Ron, though?\" he said. \"Don't you want to go", "gt": "with him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh... well...\" Hermione went slightly pink. \"I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry flatly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh Harry, this is so stupid -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come, but I'm not meeting Ron, and I'm wearing my Invisibility Cloak.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh all right then...\" Hermione snapped, \"but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I never know if I'm looking at you or not", "response": "with him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh... well...\" Hermione went slightly pink. \"I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry flatly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh Harry, this is so stupid -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come, but I'm not meeting Ron, and I'm wearing my Invisibility Cloak.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh all right then...\" Hermione snapped, \"but I hate talking to you in that cloak, I never know", "rougeL": 0.9411764705882353, "rougeL_recall": 0.8888888888888888, "rouge1": 0.9411764705882353, "rouge1_recall": 0.8888888888888888}, {"prompt": "er under his cloak. \"Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!\" she hissed back. \"You know, I'm starting to think it's time for more direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea, ask Fred and George,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks. Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends. She wasn't wearing a Cedric badge though.... This cheered up Harry very slightly.\n\u3000\u3000What wouldn't he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn't come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn't be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He'd have been really hooking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was...cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands...\n\u3000\u3000He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring over books.\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly.\n\u3000\u3000He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire - assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately...\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, it's Hagrid!\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000The back of Hagrid's enormous shaggy head - he had mercifully abandoned his bunches -emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn't spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn't seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn't see him. Moody, however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione's table.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, Hermione?\" said Hagrid loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" said Hermione, smiling back.\n\u3000\u3000Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading the S.P.E.W.\n\u3000\u3000notebook, until he muttered, \"Nice cloak, Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody's nose was particularly obvious at a few inches' distance. Moody grinned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can your eye - I mean, can you -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,\" Mo", "gt": "ody said quietly. \"And it's come in useful at times, I can tell you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too.

Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could hear it, \"Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin.

Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted... she wasn't exactly hard to miss....\n\u3000\u3000But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, \"Wair is it you are taking me, 'Agrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh'll enjoy this,\" said Hagrid gruffly, \"worth seein', trust me. On'y - don' go tellin' anyone I showed yeh, right?

Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn't get there soon, he was going to turn\n\u3000\u3000around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime.\n\u3000\u3000But then - when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight - Harry heard something. Men were shouting up ahead...\n\u3000\u3000then came a deafening, earsplitting roar...\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them - for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them - and then his mouth fell open.\n\u3000\u3000Dragons.\n\u3000\u3000Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting - torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-hike than the others, which was nearest to them.\n\u3000\u3000At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs.\n\u3000\u3000Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn't tell which..\n\u3000\u3000.. It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream.\n\u3000\u3000\"Keep back there, Hagrid!\" yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. \"They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I've seen this Horntail do forty!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is'n' it beautiful?\" said Hagrid softly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's no good!\" yelled another wizard. \"Stunning Spells, on the count of three!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stupefy!\" they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons' scaly hides -Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking - then, very slowly, it fell.

And he had to get past it. With everyone watching.\n\u3000\u3000How?\n\u3000\u3000Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn't remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now -- when, without warning, he ran into something very solid.\n\u3000\u3000Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around him. A voice nearby said, \"Ouch! Who's there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee... it was Karkaroff.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's there?\" said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness.\n\u3000\u3000Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together - they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance... and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions.\n\u3000\u3000By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.\n\u3000\u3000Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn't dare slow down.... He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Balderdash!\" he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you say so,\" she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light.\n\u3000\u3000Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggory! badges the Creeveys had been trying to\n\u3000\u3000improve were glinting in the firelight. They now read POTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius's head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn't seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys' kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits.

There's someone coming!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire - if someone saw Sirius's face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar - the Ministry would get dragged in - he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius's whereabouts - Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at one o'clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon?\n\u3000\u3000It was Ron.

When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn't do it. It was the only place he had ever been happy... well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn't remember that.\n\u3000\u3000Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer.

He\n\u3000\u3000was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn't want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter's article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.\n\u3000\u3000\"Diffindo!\"\n\u3000\u3000Cedric's bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Several bottles of ink smashed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't bother,\" said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell Flitwick I'm coming, go on...\n\u3000\u3000This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric's friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi,\" said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. \"My bag just split... brand-new and all...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Cedric,\" said Harry, \"the first task is dragons.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Cedric, looking up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dragons,\" said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. \"They've got four, one for each of us, and we've got to get past them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Cedric stared at him.

Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody's next question brought him sharply back to earth.\n\u3000\u3000\"So... found out about the dragons, have you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated. He'd been afraid of this - but he hadn't told Cedric, and he certainly wasn't going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right,\" said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \"Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't cheat,\" said Harry sharply. \"It was - a sort of accident that I found out.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody grinned. \"I wasn't accusing you, laddie.

And the first bit is - play to your strengths.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't got any,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Excuse me,\" growled Moody, \"you've got strengths if I say you've got them. Think now. What are you best at?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really -- \"Quidditch,\" he said dully, \"and a fat lot of help -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. \"You're a damn good flier from what I've heard.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but...\" Harry stared at him. \"I'm not allowed a broom, I've only got my wand...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My second piece of general advice,\" said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \"is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, boy...\" whispered Moody. \"Put them together... it's not that difficult...\"\n\u3000\u3000And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire-bolt, he needed - \"Hermione,\" Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. \"Hermione - I need you to help me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think I've been trying to do, Harry?\" she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\u3000\u3000And so they practiced. They didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him.\n\u3000\u3000He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Concentrate, Harry, concentrate....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think I'm trying to do?\" said Harry angrily. \"A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason...Okay, try again....\"\n\u3000\u3000He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was", "gt": "no point in staying without her.

She didn't seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps\n\u3000\u3000and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, don't panic,\" she said, \"just keep a cool head.... We've got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand.... The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you.... Are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" Harry heard himself say. \"Yes, I'm fine.\"\n\u3000\u3000She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're to go in here with the other champions,\" said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, \"and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there... he'll be telling you the - the procedure.... Good luck.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.\n\u3000\u3000Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool. She didn't look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Good-o!\" said Bagman happily, looking around at him. \"Come in, come in, make yourself at home!\"\n\u3000\u3000Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, now we're all here - time to fill you in!\" said Bagman brightly. \"When the audience has assembled, I'm going to be offering each of you this bag\" - he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them - \"from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different - er - varieties, you see.\n\u3000\u3000And I have to tell you something else too... ah, yes... your task is to collect the golden egg!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman's words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn't reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this..\n\u3000\u3000And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking.... Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then - it seemed like about a second later to Harry - Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ladies first,\" he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.\n\u3000\u3000She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon - a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.\n\u3000\u3000The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn't even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number", "gt": "one tied around its neck.

A pause, while Fleur's marks were being shown... more clapping... then, for the third time, the whistle.\n\u3000\u3000\"And here comes Mr. Krum!\" cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.\n\u3000\u3000He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear... yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very daring!\" Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. \"That's some nerve he's showing - and - yes, he's got the egg!\"\n\u3000\u3000Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished - it would be Harry's turn any moment.\n\u3000\u3000He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited.\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.\n\u3000\u3000He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn't know or care. It was time to do\n\u3000\u3000what he had to do... to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.\n\u3000\u3000He raised his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Accio Firebolt!\" he shouted.\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying.... If it hadn't worked... if it wasn't coming... He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely....\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise.... Bagman was shouting something... but Harry's ears were not working properly anymore... listening wasn't important....\n\u3000\u3000He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened....\n\u3000\u3000As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd's faces became mere flesh-colored pinpnicks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his fear.... He was back where he belonged....\n\u3000\u3000This was just another Quidditch match, that was all... just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team.\n\u3000\u3000He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon's front legs. \"Okay,\" Harry told himself, \"diversionary tactics... let's go...\"\n\u3000\u3000He dived.

The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric's shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn't seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry's shoulder, talking furiously all the while. \"Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You're very lucky... this is quite shallow... it'll need cleaning before I heal it up, though....\"\n\u3000\u3000She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, just sit quietly for a minute - sit! And then you can go and get your score.\"\n\u3000\u3000She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, \"How does it feel now, Diggory?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he'd reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside - Hermione, followed closely by Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, you were brilliant!\" Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear. \"You were amazing! You really were!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" he said, very seriously, \"whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I reckon they're trying to do you in!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was as though the last few weeks had never happened - as though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he'd been made champion.\n\u3000\u3000\"Caught on, have you?\" said Harry coldly. \"Took you long enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay,\" he said, before Ron could get the words out. \"Forget it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, \"I shouldn't've -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Forget it, \"Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back Hermione burst into tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing to cry about!\" Harry told her, bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"You two are so stupid!\" she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Barking mad,\" said Ron, shaking his head. \"Harry, c'mon, they'll be putting up your scores....\"\n\u3000\u3000Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.\n\u3000\u3000\"You were the best, you know, no competition.

Well, off you go, then!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.\n\u3000\u3000It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Congratulations, Harry!\" she said, beaming at him. \"I wonder if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, you can have a word,\" said Harry savagely. \"Good-bye.\"\n\u3000\u3000And he set off back to the castle with Ron.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE - THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fits, doesn't it?\" he said. \"Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other.\n\u3000\u3000They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup.... I'll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he's going to be feeling really stupid now, isn't he? Didn't work, did it? You only got a scratch!\n\u3000\u3000Come here - I'll do it -\"\n\u3000\u3000Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around Harry's head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \"You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I'm serious.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry's got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\" she said seriously.\n\u3000\u3000\"If that was the first task, I hate to think what's coming next.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right little ray of sunshine, aren't you?\" said Ron. \"You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.\"\n\u3000\u3000He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window.

Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut. Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point... they were all right, really, dragons..\n\u3000\u3000..\n\u3000\u3000The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter. Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime's horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the\n\u3000\u3000comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not,\" Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. \"Thought we'd jus' try an see if they fancied a kip..\n\u3000\u3000. we'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes....\"\n\u3000\u3000There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll jus' lead 'em in here,\" Hagrid said, \"an' put the lids on, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\u3000\u3000But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, \"Don panic, now, don' panic!\" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class - Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead - had fled into Hagrid's cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don' fright", "gt": "en him, now!\" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \"Jus' try an slip the rope 'round his sting, so he won hurt any o' the others!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, we wouldn't want that!\" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid's cabin, still holding the skrew", "response": "en him, now!\" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \"Jus' try an slip the rope 'round his sting, so he won hurt any o' the others!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, we wouldn'\u9996,\" Ron whispered as the sparks hit the skrewt's back. \"Oh - ouch - it's got me.\"\n\u3000\u3000", "rougeL": 0.7945205479452055, "rougeL_recall": 0.7631578947368421, "rouge1": 0.8082191780821917, "rouge1_recall": 0.7763157894736842}, {"prompt": "!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She'll twist everything he says,\" Harry said under his breath.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or anything,\" said Hermione desperately.

Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.\n\u3000\u3000\"I would think,\" she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, \"that some of us\" - she stared very meaningfully at Harry- \"might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night.

I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is....\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione wasn't at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph - but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder where she's got to?\" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno... balderdash.\"\n\u3000\u3000But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione's arrival.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \"Harry, you've got to come - you've got to come, the most amazing thing's happened- please -\"\n\u3000\u3000She seized Harry's arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll show you when we get there - oh come on, quick -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" Harry said", "gt": ", starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh don't mind me!\" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \"Don't apologize for bothering me!

The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby, what're you doing here?\" Harry said in amazement. \"Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\" Dobby squealed excitedly. \"Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky?\" said Harry. \"She's here too?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, sir, yes!\" said Dobby, and he seized Harry's hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables\n\u3000\u3000above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.\n\u3000\u3000At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them.

Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while every one of Dobby's strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Winky,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Winky's lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh dear,\" said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \"Winky, don't cry, please don't...\"\n\u3000\u3000But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\" he squeaked loudly, over Winky's sobs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - yeah, okay,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good service!\" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.\n\u3000\u3000\"How long have you been here, Dobby?\" Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea.\n\u3000\u3000\"Only a week.

Hagrid didn't pursue the subject.\n\u3000\u3000The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn't believe half of them - for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up\n\u3000\u3000listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.\n\u3000\u3000Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions - as Binns hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn't going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percys cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.\n\u3000\u3000\"Evil, he is,\" Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. \"Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mmm... you're not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?\" said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack - a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's Christmas, Hermione,\" said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked severely over at him too. \"I'd have thought you'd be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don't want to learn your antidotes!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Like what?\" Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.\n\u3000\u3000\"That egg!\" Hermione hissed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Hermione, I've got till February the", "gt": "twenty-fourth,\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn't opened it since the celebration party after the first task.

Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.\n\u3000\u3000And still. Harry hadn't asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner; Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.\n\u3000\u3000\"I suppose there's always Moaning Myrtle,\" he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls' toilets on the second floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - we've just got to grit our teeth and do it,\" said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress. \"When we get back to the common room tonight, we'll both have partners - agreed?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er... okay,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000But every time he glimpsed Cho that day - during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic - she was surrounded by friends. Didn't she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But no - she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn't do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else.\n\u3000\u3000He found it hard to concentrate on Snape's Potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient - a bezoar - meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn't care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll meet you at dinner,\" he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.\n\u3000\u3000He'd just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all.... He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - Cho? Could I have a word with you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Giggling should be made illegal. Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn't, though.

He couldn't. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him.

They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.\n\u3000\u3000The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.\n\u3000\u3000Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron's as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely.\n\u3000\u3000But Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've been promoted,\" Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe. \"I'm now Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Crouch's personal assistant, and I'm here representing him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why didn't he come?\" Harry asked. He wasn't looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn't well, not well at all. Hasn't been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising - overwork. He's not as young as he was - though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but - well, as I say, he's getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he's found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with - that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around - no, poor man, he's having a well earned, quiet Christmas. I'm just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy \"Weatherby\"\n\u3000\u3000yet, but resisted the temptation.\n\u3000\u3000There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around - there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, \"Pork chops!\"\n\u3000\u3000And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining - surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves? - but for once, Hermione didn't seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W.

They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on!\" Parvati hissed. \"We're supposed to dance!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone's eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding\n\u3000\u3000the other tightly in hers.\n\u3000\u3000It wasn't as bad as it could have been. Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby - he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet - and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nice socks.

The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's sit down, shall we?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh - but - this is a really good one!\" Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I don't like it,\" Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.\n\u3000\u3000\"How's it going?\" Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music.\n\u3000\u3000Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her.\n\u3000\u3000Parvati sat down on Harry's other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't mind, do you, Harry?\" Parvati said.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh never mind,\" snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati's empty chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi,\" said Harry.

The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do they think they're doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\" Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. \"No respect...\"\n\u3000\u3000Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope my brothers weren't bothering you, Mr. Bagman?\" said Percy at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh not at all, not at all!\" said Bagman. \"No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko's Joke Shop....\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy didn't look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you feel the tournament's going, Mr. Bagman? Our department's quite satisfied -the hitch with the Goblet of Fire\" - he glanced at Harry - \"was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't you think?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" Bagman said cheerfully, \"it's all been enormous fun. How's old Barty doing?\n\u3000\u3000Shame he couldn't come.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh I'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,\" said Percy importantly, \"but in the meantime, I'm more than willing to take up the slack. Of course, it's not all attending balls\" - he laughed airily - \"oh no, I've had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence - you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country?

The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"... don't see what there is to fuss about, Igor.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, you cannot pretend this isn't happening!\" Karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overhe", "gt": "ard. \"It's been getting clearer and clearer for months.

Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him. Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush.\n\u3000\u3000\"I 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! 'Alf-giant? Moi? I 'ave - I 'ave big bones!\"\n\u3000\u3000She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her.\n\u3000\u3000It was much too dark to make out his expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Harry said, very quietly to Ron. \"Let's go....\"\n\u3000\u3000But Ron didn't move.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Harry, looking at him.\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you know?\" he whispered. \"About Hagrid being half-giant?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Harry said, shrugging. \"So what?\"\n\u3000\u3000He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said \"So what?\" upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll explain inside,\" said Ron quietly, \"c'mon....\"\n\u3000\u3000Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall.

He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR - RITA SKEETER'S SCOOP\n\u3000\u3000Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione's hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion on it for the ball, \"but it's way too much bother to do every day,\" she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their\n\u3000\u3000argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn't seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I thought he must be,\" she said, shrugging. \"I knew he couldn't be pure giant because they're about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants.\n\u3000\u3000They can't all be horrible.... It's the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves.... It's just bigotry, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn't want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn't looking.\n\u3000\u3000It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over -everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.\n\u3000\u3000The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn't done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn't. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the room - though he hadn't really expected that to help.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric's idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn't need that sort of rubbishy help - not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway.

Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\n\u3000\u3000Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.\n\u3000\u3000An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures.\n\u3000\u3000While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being \"very frightening.\"\n\u3000\u3000'I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,\" says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. \"We all hate Hagrid, but we're just too scared to say anything.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" highly dangerous crosses between manti-cores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was just having some fun,\" he says, before hastily changing the subject.\n\u3000\u3000As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\u3000\u3000Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\n\u3000\u3000While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors\n\u3000\u3000working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Frid-wulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.\n\u3000\u3000In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.\n\u3000\u3000Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did she find out?\" he whispered.\n\u3000\u3000But that wasn't what was bothering Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, 'we all hate Hagrid'?\" Harry spat at Malfoy. \"What's this rubbish about him\" - he pointed at Crabbe - \"getting a bad bite off a flobberworm?

They didn't see a sign of him all week. He didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.\n\u3000\u3000\"Missing your half-breed pal?\" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry's retaliation. \"Missing the elephant-man?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January.

He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages... whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.\n\u3000\u3000He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's mad!\" said Harry, staring at Krums dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. \"It must be freezing, it's January!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a lot colder where he comes from,\" said Hermione. \"I suppose it feels quite warm to him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but there's still the giant squid,\" said Ron. He didn't sound anxious - if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's really nice, you know,\" she said. \"He's not at all like you'd think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron said nothing. He hadn't mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\n\u3000\u3000The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn't there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.\n\u3000\u3000\"Doesn't he ever go into the office?\" Hermione whispered suddenly. \"Look!\"\n\u3000\u3000She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins.

The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauders Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.\n\u3000\u3000On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open.

Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, \"Go on, then... open it under the water!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it... and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he couldnt distinguish through the water.\n\u3000\u3000\"You need to put your head under too,\" said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. \"Go on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took a great breath and slid under the surface - and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands:\n\u3000\u3000\"Come seek us where our voices sound, We cannot sing above the ground, And while you re searching, ponder this:\n\u3000\u3000Wove taken what you'll sorely miss, An hour long you'll have to look, And to recover what we took, But past an hour- the prospect's black, Too late, it's gone, it wont come back\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hear it?\" said Myrtle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... 'Come seek us where our voices sound...' and if I need persuading... hang on, I need to listen again....\"\n\u3000\u3000He sank back beneath the water.

Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office... nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above.... Harry had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye...\n\u3000\u3000something distinctly odd.\n\u3000\u3000Peeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner - Snapes office. But the dot wasn't labeled \"Severus Snape\"... it was Bartemius Crouch.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball - so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one o'clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there....\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated, thinking... and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to.\n\u3000\u3000Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors.\n\u3000\u3000He kept glancing down at the map, wondering... It just didn't seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else's office this late at night....\n\u3000\u3000And then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harrys leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step - the Invisibility Cloak slipped - Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn't reach it.\n\u3000\u3000The golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below.

Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene:\n\u3000\u3000Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did I hear that correctly, Snape?\" he asked slowly. \"Someone broke into your office?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It is unimportant,\" said Snape coldly. \"On the contrary,\" growled Moody, \"it is very important. Who'd want to break into your office?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A student, I daresay,\" said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape's greasy temple. \"It has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard... students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?\" said Moody. \"Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw the edge of Snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know I'm hiding nothing, Moody,\" he said in a soft and dangerous voice, \"as you've searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moodys face twisted into a smile. \"Auror's privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore happens to trust me,\" said Snape through clenched teeth. \"I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Course Dumbledore trusts you,\" growled Moody. \"Hes a trusting man, isn't he? Believes in second chances. But me - I say there are spots that don't come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d'you know what I mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.\n\u3000\u3000Moody laughed. \"Get back to bed, Snape.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't have the authority to send me anywhere!\" Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. \"I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Prowl away,\" said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. \"I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time....

He looked up at Hagrid - perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it?\n\u3000\u3000He looked after everything else on the grounds, after all-\"\n\u3000\u3000Yeh're goin' ter win,\" Hagrid growled, patting Harrys shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. \"I know it. I can feel it. Yeh're goin' ter win, Harry n Harry just couldn't bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid's face.\n\u3000\u3000Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat them with the others.\n\u3000\u3000By the evening before the second task. Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he'd have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why hadn't he got to work on the egg's clue sooner? Why had he ever let his mind wander in class - what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater?\n\u3000\u3000He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word \"water\" on a page, but more often than not it was merely \"Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't reckon it can be done,\" said Rons voice flatly from the other side of the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There must be something,\" Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her. Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page. \"They'd never have set a task that was undoable.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They have,\" said Ron. \"Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they've nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's a way of doing it!\" Hermione said crossly. \"There Just has to be!\"\n\u3000\u3000She seemed to be taking the library's lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what I should have done,\" said Harry, resting, face-down, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts.", "gt": "\"I should've learned to be an Animagus like Sirius.\"\n\u3000\u3000An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, you could've turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Or a frog,\" yawned Harry.

He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he'd slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There's a Wand, There's a Way. He sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter needs to hurry!\" squeaked Dobby. \"The second task starts in ten minutes,\n\u3000\u3000and Harry Potter -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ten minutes?\" Harry croaked. \"Ten - ten minutes?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked down at his watch.

On the count of three, then. One... two... three!\"\n\u3000\u3000The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with cheers and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.\n\u3000\u3000It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones.\n\u3000\u3000He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen.\n\u3000\u3000He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins....\n\u3000\u3000Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck -Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold air.... He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense - he flung himself forward into the water.\n\u3000\u3000The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet - they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too:\n\u3000\u3000It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.\n\u3000\u3000The water didn't feel icy anymore either... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light.... Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the vater, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths.\n\u3000\u3000Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadow beyond, where the water became opaque.\n\u3000\u3000Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron - nor, thankfully, the giant squid.\n\u3000\u3000Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern", "gt": "shapes through the gloom... and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's leg, its pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand.\n\u3000\u3000By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized", "response": "shapes through the gloom... and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry'\u9996's leg, its pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand.\n\u3000\u3000By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed", "rougeL": 0.9870129870129869, "rougeL_recall": 0.9743589743589743, "rouge1": 0.9870129870129869, "rouge1_recall": 0.9743589743589743}, {"prompt": ", pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur\n\u3000\u3000Delacour's sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas - locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.\n\u3000\u3000He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed and shook his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"We do not help,\" he said in a harsh, croaky voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come ON!\" Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing.\n\u3000\u3000Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp... anything...\n\u3000\u3000There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were they playing at? Why didn't they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too -At once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"You take your own hostage,\" one of them said to him. \"Leave the others...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No way!\" said Harry furiously - but only two large bubbles came out.\n\u3000\u3000Your task is to retrieve your own friend... leave the others...\" She's my friend too!\" Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips. \"And I don't want them to die either!\"\n\u3000\u3000Cho's head was on Hermiones shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others?\n\u3000\u3000Would he be able to find them again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped working.\n\u3000\u3000But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them. There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got lost!\" he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. \"Fleur and Krum're coming now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Feeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free.

I thought...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come here, you,\" said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, well done!\" Hermione cried. \"You did it, you found out how all by yourself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -\" said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur's sister had got back safely. \"Yeah, that's right,\" said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,\" said Krum.

Harry noticed that Ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story, anyway - Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,\" he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. \"I could've taken those mer-idiots any time I wanted.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you going to do, snore at them?\" said Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.\n\u3000\u3000Ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.\n\u3000\u3000As they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one.\n\u3000\u3000Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon.

If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon - double Potions - feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson's gang of Slytherin girls.

Ten points from Gryffindor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah... reading magazines under the table as well?\" Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. \"A further ten points from Gryffindor... oh but of course...\" Snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter's article. \"Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings....\"\n\u3000\u3000The dungeon rang with the Slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape's thin mouth. To Harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Harry Potter's Secret Heartache... dear, dear. Potter, what's ailing you now? 'A boy like no other, perhaps...'\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now.\n\u3000\u3000\"'... Harry Potter's well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.' How very touching,\" sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \"Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives.

Now.\"\n\u3000\u3000Furious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already over-large head.

Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.\n\u3000\u3000Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's so urgent?\" he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.\n\u3000\u3000\"This,\" said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff\n\u3000\u3000pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \"Do you see?\n\u3000\u3000It's never been this clear, never since - \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Put it away!\" snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"But you must have noticed -\" Karkaroff began in an agitated voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can talk later, Karkaroff!\" spat Snape. \"Potter!

He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.\n\u3000\u3000They left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry's bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.\n\u3000\u3000They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly.\n\u3000\u3000Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had never been in this direction before.

When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me get this straight,\" he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. \"You first saw the elfin the Top Box.

He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemorts supporters. The Aurors were given new powers - powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial.

You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again - doesn't that tell you what he's like?

At least your fingers aren't full of pus.\" Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. \"I hate that Skeeter woman!\" she burst out savagely. \"I'll get her back for this if it's the last thing I do!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and although she followed Hagrid's advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear.

And then it fell upon a pair of feet.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest floor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch. Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stunned,\" he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Should I go and get someone?\" said Harry. \"Madam Pomfrey?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Dumbledore swiftly. \"Stay here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid's cabin. Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, \"Ennervate.\"\n\u3000\u3000Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.\n\u3000\u3000\"He attacked me!\" Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. \"The old madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Lie still for a moment,\" Dumbledore said.\n\u3000\u3000The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his heels.

He'd done a runner.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"He seemed really weak - I don't reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven't I told you enough times?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay... hows this for a theory,\" said Ron excitedly. \"Krum attacked Crouch - no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?\" said Hermione coldly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yeah...\"\n\u3000\u3000It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just go through it again, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"What did Mr. Crouch actually say?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault.... He mentioned his son.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was out of his mind,\" said Harry. \"Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And... remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?\" said Ron tentatively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told you,\" Harry repeated dully. \"He said he's getting stronger.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \"But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Snape hadn't held me up,\" Harry said bitterly, \"we might've got there in time.

Let's give it till break.\"\n\u3000\u3000History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn't taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.\n\u3000\u3000When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Moody?\" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Potter,\" growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody's head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you find him?\" Harry asked without preamble. \"Mr. Crouch?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you use the map?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn't anywhere on there.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So he did Disapparate?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can't Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!\" said Hermione. \"There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, Professor?\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \"You're another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\" he told her. \"Mind works the right way.

He must've left the grounds, then.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But under his own steam?\" said Hermione eagerly, \"or because someone made him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, someone could've -", "gt": "could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn't they?\" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Ron, \"d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he's not here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He", "response": "could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn'\u9996 they'd be seen, would they?\" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Ron, \"d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he's not", "rougeL": 0.9487179487179488, "rougeL_recall": 0.961038961038961, "rouge1": 0.9487179487179488, "rouge1_recall": 0.961038961038961}, {"prompt": "Harry.

Well, they would've been in the trees near us, wouldn't they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn't they? So it doesn't look like I'm their target, does it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They couldn't have made it look like an accident if they'd murdered you in the forest!\"\n\u3000\u3000said Hermione. \"But if you die during a task-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They didn't care about attacking Krum, did they?\" said Harry. \"Why didn't they just polish me off at the same time? They could've made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I don't understand it either,\" said Hermione desperately. \"I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don't like it.... Moody's right - Sirius is right -you've got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you're not going to go sneaking off alone again.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron's and Hermione's part.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't we kidnap Mrs. Norris?\" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. \"Let's Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he'd do anything to help you. I'm not complaining or anything\" - he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside - \"but I'm aching all over....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don't you!\" said Hermione impatiently, rearranging\n\u3000\u3000the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. \"Just try and fall backward!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Once you're Stunned, you can't aim too well, Hermione! \"said Ron angrily. \"Why don't you take a turn?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I think Harry's got it now, anyway,\" said Hermione hastily. \"And we don't have to worry about Disarming, because he's been able to do that for ages.... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.\"\n\u3000\u3000She looked down the list they had made in the library.\n\u3000\u3000\"I like the look of this one,\" she said, \"this Impediment Curse. Should slow down anything that's trying to attack you. Harry. We'll start with that one.\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"See you at dinner!\" said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's going to be boiling in Trelawney's room, she never puts out that fire,\" said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.\n\u3000\u3000He was quite right.

Come now.

He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore's office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream... it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive.... He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them.... He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder... but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead... so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake... he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead....\n\u3000\u3000Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office without noticing.

He stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore, I'm afraid I don't see the connection, don't see it at all!\" It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. \"Ludo says Berthas perfectly capable of\n\u3000\u3000getting herself lost.

It had stopped hurting now.\n\u3000\u3000He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore's office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk.\n\u3000\u3000The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as\n\u3000\u3000the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry's House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.\n\u3000\u3000A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the basin's contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liquid - or like wind made solid - Harry couldn't make up his mind.\n\u3000\u3000He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years' experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.\n\u3000\u3000The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin - and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.\n\u3000\u3000Where was this place? It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.\n\u3000\u3000The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see...\n\u3000\u3000The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch - Harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin -But his head did not hit the stone bottom.

As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Nevilles snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom.... He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors.... He understood how they had felt.... Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later....\n\u3000\u3000It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort....

Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment.

Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter's strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.\n\u3000\u3000Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway through a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying.\n\u3000\u3000It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You-Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deep-seated confusion.\n\u3000\u3000\"He might even be pretending,\" said one specialist. \"This could be a plea for attention.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter can speak Parseltongue,\" reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year. \"There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he's made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he'd do anything for a bit of power.\"\n\u3000\u3000Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art.\n\u3000\u3000Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You-Know-Who himself.\n\u3000\u3000A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue \"as worthy of investigation.\n\u3000\u3000Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.\" Similarly, \"anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.\"\n\u3000\u3000Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.

Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Lumos,\" and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.\n\u3000\u3000After about fifty yards, they reached a fork.

Still, there was nothing in sight.\n\u3000\u3000Bagman's whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions were now inside.\n\u3000\u3000Harry kept looking behind him.

That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible.\n\u3000\u3000The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn't know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by now? It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security.

Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him.

He had a choice of paths up ahead. \"Point Me!\" he whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the right-hand one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.\n\u3000\u3000The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs -Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it -\"\n\u3000\u3000Cedric!\" Harry bellowed. \"On your left!\"\n\u3000\u3000Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric's wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stupefy!\" Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider's gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!\"\n\u3000\u3000But it was no use - the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers before it was upon him.\n\u3000\u3000He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain. He could hear Cedric yelling \"Stupefy!\" too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry's - Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted \"Expelliarmus!\"\n\u3000\u3000It worked - the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him. Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted \"Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same thing.\n\u3000\u3000The two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" he heard Cedric shouting. \"You all right?

A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie. \"Is this supposed to be part of the task?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno,\" said Cedric.

Harry couldn't make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.\n\u3000\u3000Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And - several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby... or was it merely a bundle of robes?\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.\n\u3000\u3000It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them.

It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.\n\u3000\u3000From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, \"Kill the spare.\"\n\u3000\u3000A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: \"Avada Kedavra!\"\n\u3000\u3000A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.\n\u3000\u3000For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised.

For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud.\n\u3000\u3000Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please... let it drown....\n\u3000\u3000Wormtail was speaking.

Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtails remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry's cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.\n\u3000\u3000He staggered back to the cauldron with Harrys blood.

The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. \"Come along... hospital wing...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Dumbledore sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore, he ought to - look at him - he's been through enough tonight -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,\" said Dumbledore curtly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight,\n\u3000\u3000and why,\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody,\" Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. \"How can it have been Moody?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is not Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"You have never known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew - and I followed.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore bent down over Moody's limp form and put a hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody's hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned to Professors McGonagall and Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid's house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here.\"\n\u3000\u3000If either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It contained a mass of spell-books. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneako-scopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk each time, and revealing different contents each time. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.\n\u3000\u3000He was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stunned - controlled", "gt": "by the Imperius Curse - very weak,\" he said. \"Of course, they would have needed to keep him alive.

My father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.\"\n\u3000\u3000The man's eyelids flickered.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Staged my mother's death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controlled.\n\u3000\u3000My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master... of returning to his service.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How did your father subdue you?\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Imperius Curse,\" Moody said. \"I was under my fathers control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats.\n\u3000\u3000Rewards for my good behavior.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Master Barty, Master Barty,\" sobbed Winky through her hands. \"You isn't ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?\" said Dumbledore softly. \"Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. \"A witch in my father's office.\n\u3000\u3000Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father s signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She confronted him. He\n\u3000\u3000put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she'd found out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory permanently.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why is she coming to nose into my masters private business?\" sobbed Winky. \"Why isn't she leaving us be?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky talked my father into it,\" said Crouch, still in the same monotonous voice. \"She spent months persuading him.

I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master. But first -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You needed Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father's house, and to keep watch over my father.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But your father escaped,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.\n\u3000\u3000\"My master sent me word of my father's escape. He told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Map?\" said Dumbledore quickly. \"What map is this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter's map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape.\n\u3000\u3000\"For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum.\n\u3000\u3000I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000I Stunned Krum.

Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore.\n\u3000\u3000There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Lo, Fawkes,\" said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore stopped talking.

He was going to make Harry relive everything.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze.

Let him rest.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius's words. He leaned forward toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I thought I could help you,\" Dumbledore said gently, \"by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it.

I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\n\u3000\u3000He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric's body, lying on the ground beside the cup.\n\u3000\u3000Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry's shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.\n\u3000\u3000When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started.

The phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry's injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.\n\u3000\u3000\"I will say it again,\" said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. \"You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight.

Harry - I will wait while you get into bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others not to\n\u3000\u3000question him. It wasn't as though he didn't want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand.\n\u3000\u3000\"I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.\" He left.\n\u3000\u3000As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room.

He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \"You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a moment's silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, I believe Harry,\" said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \"I heard Crouch's confession, and I heard Harry's account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who... well...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped.

I've had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I've kept quiet.

All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. \"You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter's Dumbledore's favorite boy again. Big deal.\"\n\u3000\u3000His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Trying not to think about it, are we?\" said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. \"Trying to pretend it hasn't happened?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledores speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand", "gt": "under his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you!

Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He's lost everything gambling. Hasn't got two Galleons to rub together.\n\u3000\u3000And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"He put a bet on you, mate,\" said Fred. \"Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's why he kept trying to help me win!\" said Harry. \"Well - I did win, didn't I?\n\u3000\u3000So he can pay you your gold!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said George, shaking his head. \"The goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you'd win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task.\"\n\u3000\u3000George sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.\n\u3000\u3000The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King's Cross... but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fred - George - wait a moment.\"\n\u3000\u3000The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard winnings.\n\u3000\u3000\"Take it,\" he said, and he thrust the sack into George's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Fred, looking flabbergasted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Take it,\" Harry repeated firmly. \"I don't want it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're mental,\" said George, trying to push it back at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm not,\" said Harry. \"You take it, and get inventing. It's for the joke shop.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He is mental,\" Fred said in an almost awed voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen,\" said Harry firmly. \"If you don't take it, I'm throwing it down the drain. I don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, \"there's got to be a thousand Galleons in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Think how many Canary Creams that is.\"\n\u3000\u3000The twins stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just don't tell your mum where you got it... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look,\" he said flatly, \"take it, or I'll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they're from you.\"\n\u3000\u3000He left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe,\n\u3000\u3000and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks.\n\u3000\u3000Un", "gt": "cle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier.
